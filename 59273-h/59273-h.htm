<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p>“Indeed, I am not quite assured in my mind that
the influence of Mr. Garrick upon such a family
as ours is healthy,” said Mrs. Burney, when the breakfast
cups had been removed and the maid had left the
room in the little house in St. Martin’s Street, off Leicester
Fields. Dr. Burney, the music-master, had not
to hurry away this day: his first lesson did not begin
until noon; it was to be given at the mansion of Mr.
Thrale, the brewer, at Streatham, and the carriage was
not to call for him for another hour. He was glancing
at the <cite>Advertiser</cite> in unaccustomed indolence, but when
his wife had spoken he glanced up from the paper and
an expression of amused surprise was upon his face.
His daughter Fanny glanced up from the work-basket
which her mother had placed ready for her the moment
that the breakfast-table had been cleared, and the expression
upon little Miss Burney’s face was one that had
something of fright in it. She was too short-sighted to
see the wink which her brother James, lieutenant in His
Majesty’s navy, gave her, for their stepmother had her
back turned to him. But Mrs. Burney, without seeing
him, knew that, as he himself would phrase it, he had
tipped Fanny a wink. She turned quickly round upon
him, and if she had previously any doubt on this point,
it was at once dispelled by the solemnity of his face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. Burney gave a laugh.</p>

<p>“The influence of Mr. Garrick is like that of the air
we breathe,” said he. “It is not to be resisted by the
age we live in, leaving family matters out of the question
altogether: the Burney family must inhale as much
of the spirit of Mr. Garrick as the rest of the town—they
cannot help themselves, <i lang="fr">ces pauvres Burneys!</i> they cannot
live without Mr. Garrick.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burney shook her head solemnly; so did Lieutenant
James Burney, for he had all his life been under the
influence of Mr. Garrick, when the atmosphere brought
by Mr. Garrick was one of comedy.</p>

<p>“My meaning is that Mr. Garrick is not content to
allow simple people such as ourselves to live as simple
people,” said Mrs. Burney. “I protest that I have felt
it; the moment he enters our house we seem to be in a
new world—whatsoever world it is his whim to carry us
to.”</p>

<p>“That is the truth, my dear—he can do what he
pleases with us and with all the thousands who have
flocked to his playhouse since his Goodman’s Fields days—he
has made a fortune as a courier; transporting
people to another world for an hour or two every night—a
world that is less humdrum than this in which four
beats go to every bar and every crotchet goes to a beat!
Dear soul! he has made our hearts beat at times beyond
all computation of time and space.”</p>

<p>“You will herring-bone the edges neatly, Fanny; I
noticed some lack of neatness in the last of the napery
that left your hand, my dear,” said Mrs. Burney, bending
over her stepdaughter at her work-basket; and,
indeed, it seemed that the caution was not unnecessary,
for Fanny’s eyes were gleaming and she was handling
her work with as great indifference (for the moment) as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
though she esteemed plain sewing something of drudgery
rather than a delight. And now, having administered
her timely caution, the good lady turned to her husband,
saying:</p>

<p>“To my mind what you have claimed for Mr. Garrick
but adds emphasis to my contention that his visits have
a disturbing influence upon a homely family, taking
them out of themselves, so to speak, and transporting
them far beyond the useful work of their daily life. I
have noticed with pain for some time past that Fanny’s
heart has not been in her work: her cross-stitch has
been wellnigh slovenly, and her herring-boning has really
been indifferent—I say it with sorrow; but dear Fanny
is too good a girl to take offence at my strictures, which
she knows are honest and meant for her good.”</p>

<p>“Madam,” said Lieutenant Burney, “I pray you to
give me leave to bear you out; but at the same time to
make excuses for Fan. I must do so in justice to her,
for the blame rests with me so far as the herring-boning
is concerned. I confess, with tears in my eyes, that
’twas I who provided her with the last models for her
herring-boning; and ’twas surely some demon in my
breast that prompted me to substitute the skeleton of
one of the South Sea fishes which I hooked when becalmed
with Captain Cook within sight of Otaheite, for
the true herring whose backbone is a model of regularity
to be followed by all workers with the needle, when
deprived of the flesh, which is the staple fare of hundreds
of honest families and, while nourishing them
amply, prevents their thoughts from carrying them beyond
the region pervaded by the smell of their cooking.”</p>

<p>“That were a wide enough area upon occasions for
the most ambitious of thinkers,” said Dr. Burney, controlling
his features, seeing that his wife took the ward-room<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
humour of his son with dreadful seriousness. He
made a sign to James to go no further—but James had
gone round the world once, and he was not to be checked
in a humbler excursion.</p>

<p>“Yes, madam, ’tis my duty to confess that Fanny’s
model was the flying-fish, and not the simple Channel
herring, hence the failure to achieve the beautiful regularity
of design which exists in the backbone of the latter
from the figurehead to the stern, larboard sloping in one
direction and starboard in the other. If anyone be
culpable ’tis myself, not Fanny; but I throw myself on
your mercy, and only implore that the herring-boning
of my sister will not result in a whaling for me.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burney looked seriously from her brother to
Fanny, and getting no cue from either, began:</p>

<p>“’Tis indeed honourable for you to endeavour by your
confession to excuse the fault of your sister, James—”</p>

<p>“The traditions of the service, madam—” began the
lieutenant, laying his hand on his heart; but he got no
further, for Fanny could restrain herself no longer; she
burst into a laugh and dropped her work, and her father
rose, holding up his hand.</p>

<p>“The jest has gone far enough, James,” he said.
“We sleep in beds in this house and do not swing in
hammocks. Keep your deep-sea jests until you are out
of soundings, if it please you.”</p>

<p>“I ask your pardon, sir,” said James; “but i’ faith
there’s many a true word said in jest; and it seems to
me that there’s a moral in the parable of the young
woman who took the flying-fish of the South Seas for her
model rather than the herring of the three-fathom coastline
of the Channel; and that moral touches close upon
the complaint made by our good mother against Mr.
Garrick.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>“Let it be so,” said Mrs. Burney, who was a clever
enough woman to perceive that it would be unwise to
make a grievance of the impudence of a young naval
gentleman. “Let it be so; let it be that we are simple,
homely, wholesome herrings, we are none the better for
such a flying-fish as Mr. Garrick coming among us, giving
us, it may be, the notion that our poor fins are wings,
and so urging us to make fools of ourselves by emulating
the eagle. The moral of your fable is that we should
keep to our own element—is not that so, sir?”</p>

<p>“I’ faith, madam, I am not sure but that ’tis so, and
I haul down my colours to you, and feel no dishonour
in the act,” cried James. “Lord, where should we all
be to-day if it were not for the good women who hold
fast to the old traditions of the distaff and needle? They
are the women who do more for the happiness of men
than all who pass their time dipping quills in inkhorns
or daubing paint upon good canvas that might with luck
be hung from a stunsail boom and add another knot to
the log of a frigate of seventy-two! Is there anyone
who dines at the table of Sir Joshua Reynolds round the
corner that does not wish with all his heart that his sister
would sell her palette and buy a wine-glass or two with
the proceeds? Why, when we went to dinner at Sir
Joshua’s yesterday there were not enough glasses to go
round the table.”</p>

<p>“There never are—that is well known,” said Mrs.
Burney.</p>

<p>“Nay, nay; let us take to ourselves the reproof of Dr.
Johnson to Mr. Boswell when he complained, loud enough
almost for Sir Joshua himself to hear him, about the
scarcity of service. ‘Sir,’ said Dr. Johnson, ‘some who
have the privilege of sitting at this table, and you are one
of them, sir, will be wiser if they keep their ears open<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
and their mouths shut than they would if they had the
means of drinking all that you are longing to drink.’”</p>

<p>“Mr. Boswell, in spite of the reproof, contrived to
lurch from the table with more wine than wisdom ’tween
decks,” remarked James.</p>

<p>“He must have found a wine-glass,” said Miss Susy
Burney, who had been quite silent but quite attentive
to every word that had been spoken since breakfast-time.</p>

<p>“And so the honour of Mrs. Reynolds’s housekeeping
is saved,” said Dr. Burney.</p>

<p>“Nay, sir, is not Mr. Boswell a Scotsman?” cried the
irrepressible James.</p>

<p>“That is his lifelong sorrow, since he fancies it to be
an insuperable barrier between his idol, Dr. Johnson,
and himself,” replied his father. “But how does his
Scotsmanship bear upon the wine-glass question?”</p>

<p>“Ah, sir, without being versed in the subtleties of
theology I make bold to think that Father Adam did not
suffer hunger until knives and forks were invented,”
said James. “Your drouthy Scot will drink straight
from the bottle if no beaker be at hand. Oh, why was
not Mr. Garrick at Sir Joshua’s to rouse our spirits
by his imitation of Mr. Boswell seeking for a wine-glass—and
after?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Boswell is too trivial a subject for Davy: I have
seen him take off Dr. Johnson mixing a bowl of punch
until I was like to die of laughter. I protest that when
he came to the squeezing of the imaginary lemon, while
he cried out in the Doctor’s broadest Lichfield, ‘Who’s
for poonch?’ I could smell the acid juice,” said Dr.
Burney, and he laughed at the recollection of Garrick’s
fooling.</p>

<p>The naval man gave a resounding nautical smack to
his thigh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>“That is what ’tis to be a sailor,” he cried. “I have
had no chance of seeing Mr. Garrick at his best. I should
dearly like to hear him take off Mr. Boswell when three
sheets in the wind. Why was he not with us yesterday?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Garrick himself has had a drinking bout on. He
has been at the Wells for the past fortnight,” said his
father.</p>

<p>“<i lang="la">Ecce signum!</i>” came a doleful voice from the door,
and a little man slowly put round the jamb a face
bearing such an expression of piteous nausea as caused
everyone in the room—not even excepting Mrs. Burney—to
roar with laughter—uncontrollable laughter.</p>

<p>Then the expression on the little man’s face changed
to one of surprised indignation. He crept into the room
and looked at every person therein with a different expression
on his face for each—a variation of his original
expression of disgust and disappointment mingled
with doleful reproof. It seemed as if it was not a single
person who had entered the room, but half a
dozen persons—a whole doleful and disappointed family
coming upon an unsympathetic crew convulsed with
hilarity.</p>

<p>And then he shook his head sadly.</p>

<p>“And these are the people who have just heard that I
have been taking the nauseous waters of Tunbridge
Wells for a whole fortnight,” and there was a break in
his voice. “Oh, Friendship, are thou but a name? Oh,
Sympathy, art thou but a mask? Is the world of sentiment
nothing more than a world of shadows? Have all
the sweet springs of compassion dried up, leaving us
nothing but the cataracts of chalybeate to nauseate the
palate?”</p>

<p>He looked round once more, and putting the tips of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
his fingers together, glanced sadly up to the ceiling, then
sighed and turned as if to leave the room.</p>

<p>“Nay, sir,” cried Dr. Burney, “I do not believe that
the chalybeate cataracts still flow: ’tis my firm belief,
from the expression of your face, that you have swallowed
the whole spring—the Wells of Tunbridge must
have been dried up by you before you left—your face
betrays you. I vow that so chalybeate an expression
could not be attained by lesser means.”</p>

<p>“Sir, you do me honour, and you have a larger faith
in me than my own physician,” said the little man,
brightening up somewhat. “Would you believe that
he had the effrontery to accuse me of shirking the hourly
pailful that he prescribed for me?”</p>

<p>“He had not seen you as we have, Mr. Garrick,” said
Dr. Burney.</p>

<p>“He accused me of spending my days making matches
and making mischief in the Assembly Rooms and only
taking the waters by sips—me, sir, that have so vivid a
memory of Mr. Pope’s immortal lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">A little sipping is a dangerous thing,</div>
<div class="verse">Drink deep or taste not the chalybeate spring!”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“You were traduced, my friend—but tell us of the
matches and the mischief and we shall be the more firmly
convinced of your integrity.”</p>

<p>“Nay, sir; I give you my word that ’twas but the
simplest of matches—not by any means of the sort that
yonder desperado fresh from the South Seas applies to
the touch-hole of one of his horrible ten-pounders when
the enemy’s frigate has to be sunk—nay, a simple little
match with no more powder for it to burn than may be
found on the wig of a gentleman of fifty-two and on the
face of a lady of forty-five—the one a gay bachelor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
t’other a ripe widow—‘made for one another,’ said I;
and where was the mischief in that? And if I ventured
to broach the subject of the appropriateness of the
union of the twain, and to boast under the inspiring
influence of the chalybeate spring that I could bring it
about, is there anyone that will hint that I was not acting
out of pure good nature and a desire to make two worthy
folk happy—as happy as marriage can make any two—”</p>

<p>“Give us their names, sir, and let us judge on that
basis,” said Dr. Burney.</p>

<p>“I have no desire to withhold them, my dear Doctor;
for I want you to back me up, and I am sure that—oh,
Lord! here comes the man himself. For the love of
heaven, back me up, Doctor, and all will be well.”</p>

<p>“Nay, I will not be dragged by the hair of the head
into any of your plots, my friend,” cried Burney.
“Nay, not I. I have some reputation to maintain, good
friend Garrick; you must play alone the part of Puck
that you have chosen for yourself this many a year.
Think not that you will induce me to study the character
under you, and so thus—”</p>

<p>The manservant threw open the door of the room,
announcing:</p>

<p>“Mr. Kendal to wait upon you, sir.”</p>

<p>But by the time a small and rather rotund gentleman
had been ushered into the room, Mr. Garrick was apparently
engaged in an animated conversation with Miss
Burney on the subject of the table-cover at which she was
working.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p>The visitor walked with the short strut of the man
who at least does not underrate his own importance
in the world. But he suggested just at the moment the
man who is extremely nervous lest he may not appear
perfectly self-possessed. There was an air of bustle
about him as he strutted into the room, saying:</p>

<p>“Dr. Burney, I am your servant, sir. I have done
myself the honour to visit you on a rather important
piece of business.”</p>

<p>“Sir, you have conferred honour upon me,” said Dr.
Burney.</p>

<p>Then the gentleman seemed to become aware for the
first time that there were other people in the room; but it
was with an air of reluctance that he felt called on to
greet the others.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Burney, I think,” he said, bowing to that lady,
“and her estimable family, I doubt not. Have I not had
the privilege of meeting Mrs. Burney at the house of—of
my friend—my esteemed friend, Mrs. Barlowe? And
this gentleman of the Fleet—ha, to be sure I have heard
that there was a Lieutenant Burney of the Navy! And—gracious
heavens! Mr. Garrick!”</p>

<p>Mr. Garrick had revealed himself from the recesses of
Miss Burney’s work-basket. He, at any rate, was sufficiently
self-possessed to pretend to be vastly surprised.
He raised both his hands, crying:</p>

<p>“Is it possible that this is Mr. Kendal? But surely
I left you at the Wells no later than—now was it not the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
night before last? You were the cynosure of the Assembly
Rooms, sir, if I may make bold to say so. But I
could not look for you to pay attention to a poor actor
when you were receiving the attentions of the young,
and, may I add without offence, the fair? But no, sir;
you will not find that I am the one to tell tales out of
school, though I doubt not you have received the congratulations
of—”</p>

<p>“There you go, sir, just the same as the rest of them!”
cried the visitor. “Congratulations! felicitations! smiles
of deep meaning from the ladies, digs in the ribs with
suggestive winks from the gentlemen—people whose
names I could not recall—whom I’ll swear I had never
spoken to in my life—that is why I left the Wells as
hastily as if a tipstaff had been after me—that is why I
am here this morning, after posting every inch of the
way, to consult Dr. Burney as to my position.”</p>

<p>“I protest, sir, that I do not quite take you,” said Mr.
Garrick, with the most puzzled expression on his face
that ever man wore. “Surely, sir, your position as a
man of honour is the most enviable one possible to
imagine! Mrs. Nash—”</p>

<p>“There you blurt out the name, Mr. Garrick, and that
is what I had no intention of doing, even when laying my
case before Dr. Burney, who is a man of the world, and
whom I trust to advise me what course I should pursue.”</p>

<p>“I ask your pardon, sir,” said Mr. Garrick humbly;
“but if the course you mean to pursue has aught to do
with the pursuit of so charming a lady, and a widow to
boot—”</p>

<p>“How i’ the name of all that’s reasonable did that
gossip get about?” cried the visitor. “I give you my
word that I have not been pursuing the lady—I met her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
at the Wells for the first time a fortnight ago—pursuit
indeed!”</p>

<p>“Nay, sir, I did not suggest that the pursuit was on
your part,” said Garrick in a tone of irresistible flattery.
“But ’tis well known that as an object of pursuit of the
fair ones, the name of Mr. Kendal has been for ten years
past acknowledged without a peer.”</p>

<p>The gentleman held up a deprecating hand, but the
smile that was on his face more than neutralized his
suggestion.</p>

<p>“Nay, Mr. Garrick, I am but a simple country gentleman,”
he cried. “To be sure, I have been singled out
more than once for favours that might have turned the
head of an ordinary mortal—one of them had a fortune
and was the toast of the district; another—”</p>

<p>“If you will excuse me, gentlemen, the Miss Burneys
and myself will take our leave of you: we have household
matters in our hands,” said Mrs. Burney, making a
sign to Fanny and her sister, and going toward the door.</p>

<p>“Have I said too much, madam? If so, I pray of you
to keep my secret,” cried the visitor. “The truth is
that I have confidence in the advice of Dr. Burney as a
man of the world.”</p>

<p>“I fear that to be a man of the world is to be of the
flesh and the devil as well,” said Dr. Burney.</p>

<p>“Augmented qualifications for giving advice on an
affair of the Wells,” said Garrick slyly to the naval
lieutenant.</p>

<p>“You will not forget, Doctor, that Mr. Thrale’s carriage
is appointed to call for you within the hour,” said
Mrs. Burney over her shoulder as she left the room.</p>

<p>Fanny and her sister were able to restrain themselves
for the few minutes necessary to fly up the narrow stairs,
but the droll glance that Mr. Garrick had given them as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
they followed their mother, wellnigh made them disgrace
themselves by bursting out within the hearing of their
father’s visitor. But when they reached the parlour at
the head of the stairs and had thrown themselves in a
paroxysm of laughter on the sofa, Mrs. Burney reproved
them with some gravity.</p>

<p>“This is an instance, if one were needed, of the unsettling
influence of Mr. Garrick,” she said. “He has
plainly been making a fool of that conceited gentleman,
and it seems quite likely that he will persuade your
father to back him up.”</p>

<p>“I do not think that Mr. Garrick could improve
greatly upon Nature’s handiwork in regard to that poor
Mr. Kendal,” said Fanny. “But what would life be
without Mr. Garrick?”</p>

<p>“It would be more real, I trust,” said her stepmother.
“He would have us believe that life is a comedy, and
that human beings are like the puppets which Mr. Foote
put on his stage for the diversion of the town a few years
ago.”</p>

<p>Fanny Burney became grave; the longer she was living
in the world, the more impressed was she becoming
with the idea that life was a puppet-show; only when
the puppets began to dance on their wires in a draught
of wind from another world the real comedy began. She
felt that as an interpreter of life Mr. Garrick had no
equal on the stage or off. On the stage he could do no
more than interpret other people’s notions of life, and
these, except in the case of Shakespeare, were, she
thought, mostly feeble; but when he was off the stage—well,
Sir Joshua Reynolds had told her what that queer
person, Dr. Goldsmith, had written about Garrick—the
truest criticism Garrick had ever received: “’Twas
only that when he was off he was acting.” She knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
what she herself owed to Garrick from the time she was
nine years old, when he had accustomed her and her
sister to look for him at their house almost daily; she
knew that whatever sense of comedy she possessed—and
she looked on it as a precious possession—was to be attributed
to the visits of Garrick. Every time she looked
at her carefully locked desk in that room at the top of
the house in St. Martin’s Street, which had once been
Sir Isaac Newton’s observatory, she felt that without the
tuition in comedy that she had received at the hands of
Mr. Garrick, the contents of that desk would have been
very different. Her stepmother, however, had no information
on this point; she had lived all her life among
the good tradespeople of Lynn, and had known nothing
of Mr. Garrick until Dr. Burney had married her and
brought her to look after his children, which Fanny
knew she had done faithfully, according to her lights, in
London.</p>

<p>Fanny kept silent on the subject of Mr. Garrick’s
fooling, while Mrs. Burney bent with great gravity over
the cutting out of a pinafore for Fanny’s little niece—also
a Burney; and every now and again there came
from the closed room downstairs the sound of the insisting
voice of the visitor. She hoped that Mr. Garrick
would re-enact the scene for her; she had confidence that
it would lose nothing by its being re-enacted by Mr.
Garrick.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p>“I suppose that I must e’en follow in the wake of
the womenkind,” said Lieutenant Burney, making
an extremely slow move in the direction of the door,
when the door had been closed upon his stepmother and
his sisters.</p>

<p>“Is there any need?” asked Garrick. “It seems to
me that in such a case as this which Mr. Kendal promises
to propound to your father, His Majesty’s Navy should
be represented. In all matters bearing upon a delicate
<i lang="fr">affaire de cœur</i> surely a naval man should be present to
act as assessor.”</p>

<p>Mr. Kendal looked puzzled.</p>

<p>“I fail to take your meaning, sir,” said he, after a
pause; he was still rubbing his chin with a forefinger,
when Garrick cried:</p>

<p>“Oh, sir, surely the advantage of the counsel of an
officer trained to navigate femininity in the shape of a
ship, is apparent: a ship, even though a three-decker
ready to fire a broadside of a hundred guns, is invariably
alluded to as ‘she,’” said he, airily.</p>

<p>“Such an one must surely be the most formidable
piece of femininity in the world,” said Mr. Kendal.</p>

<p>“By no means,” said Garrick. “During my career
as manager of a playhouse I have had to face worse.
Still, the training of a naval officer in dealing with feminine
craft—at times off a lee shore, and often during a
storm at sea—nothing to be compared to the tempests in
our green-room—is certain to be of value. You will
stay, Lieutenant Burney, if it please you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>“I should be most unwilling to obtrude upon your
council, sir,” said young Burney, “unless you are convinced
that my humble services—”</p>

<p>“You have been among the savages of the South Seas,
and you are acquainted with all the rules of chasing and
capturing prizes, all of the feminine gender—I allude
to your sloops and frigates and catamarans—I take it for
granted that a catamaran is as feminine in its ways as
any wherry that floats,” cried Garrick. Then he turned
to their visitor, who was looking more puzzled than ever.</p>

<p>“You may reckon yourself fortunate in the presence
of our young friend, sir,” he said. “So far as I can
gather this is a case of chase, with a possible capture of
a prize. I venture to think that in these days a gentleman
of family and fortune, like yourself, is something of
a prize, Mr. Kendal.”</p>

<p>This was language that contained nothing to puzzle
anyone, the visitor perceived. His face brightened, and
he waved young Burney to a seat.</p>

<p>“I take it that Mr. Garrick knows what he is talking
about,” he said. “And though it was truly your father
to whom I came for counsel, I doubt not that you will
take my part, should the worst come to the worst.”</p>

<p>“Which means, should the lady come to the gentleman,
Mr. Burney,” said Garrick.</p>

<p>“Pay out your yarn, sir: I gather that you are still to
the windward of your enemy, and that is the position
which the books tell us we should manœuvre for,” cried
the nautical assessor.</p>

<p>Dr. Burney sat silently by, he had no mind to join in
the fooling of the others. Dr. Burney had never in his
life lost a sense of his own dignity. He had been a
church organist for thirty years, and no man who has
had such an experience of the control of an instrument<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
of such superlative dignity could be otherwise than dignified.
He had never once run off on a keyboard a single
phrase of “The Beggar’s Opera.” Even Handel’s
“Ruddier than the Cherry,” with Mr. Gay’s ticklish
rhymed line about “Kidlings blithe and merry,” he
only played apologetically, allowing it to be clearly
understood that Mr. Handel and Mr. Gay divided between
them the responsibility for so frivolous a measure.</p>

<p>He remained dignified and silent while Garrick and
James carried on their fooling. Only a short time before
he had occasion to reprove the lack of dignity on
the part of his important patroness, Mrs. Thrale, the
wife of the wealthy brewer, in having put herself behind
Signor Piozzi while he was singing a sentimental canzone
and mimicked his southern fervour of expression. Mrs.
Thrale had taken his reproof in good part at the time;
but no one—least of all Mrs. Thrale herself—could have
foreseen that her contrition should extend so far as to
cause her to marry the singer on the death of Mr. Thrale.</p>

<p>“To be brief, sir,” said Mr. Kendal, addressing, not
Dr. Burney, whom he had come to consult, but Mr. Garrick,
who had shown himself to be much more sympathetic.
“To be brief, I had gone to the Wells as my
custom has been for the past twenty years. I went
honestly to drink the waters, not making it an excuse,
as so many do, for indulging in the gaieties, or, I may
add, the intrigues, of the Assembly Rooms. I was civil,
as I hoped, to everyone, but, I give you my word, no
more so to Mrs. Nash than any other lady.”</p>

<p>“I do not doubt that you believe this, sir,” said Garrick,
with an indulgent wave of the hand; “but when a
lady has eyes only for one gentleman, she is apt to place
a construction upon the simplest of his civilities beyond
that assigned to it by ordinary people; but pray proceed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
sir. I will only add that it was quite well known
at the Wells that the lady regarded you with the tenderest
of emotions. Had she not boldly said to Lady ——
no; I dare not mention her name; but her ladyship is
invariably what the Italians term <i lang="it">simpatica</i> in regard to
the tender affairs of her sisters—and it was to her that
Mrs. Nash confided her secret—referring to you as bearing
a striking resemblance to the Apollo Belvedere, hoping
that her doing so would not cause anyone to accuse her
of Pagan leanings.”</p>

<p>“Is it possible! The poor lady! poor lady! But I
was not to blame. I can justly acquit myself of all
blame in this unhappy affair,” said Mr. Kendal.</p>

<p>“You are quite right, sir; is it a man’s fault that he
should bear a striking likeness to the Apollo—I doubt
not that the resemblance has caused you some annoyance
at various times of your life, Mr. Kendal,” said Garrick.</p>

<p>“Never, sir, never—at least—” he took a step to one
side that allowed of his having a full-length view of his
reflection in the narrow mirror that filled up the space
between the windows; and the result of his scrutiny of
the picture was certainly not displeasing to him. He
boldly put forward a leg, and then quite unconsciously,
as anyone could see, struck an attitude, though not quite
that of the Apollo Belvedere. Then he smirked.</p>

<p>“A leg like yours, Mr. Kendal, to say nothing of the
poise of your head, is a great responsibility,” said Garrick
seriously. “The poor lady!—poor ladies!—I confess
that I have heard of others. And she acknowledged
to you that—that—oh, that most delicate of secrets!”</p>

<p>“Never to me, sir—never in my hearing, I give you
my word,” cried the man emphatically. “Nay, I did
not so much as suspect it. The first intimation that I had
of the matter was when, on Monday morning last—only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
three days ago—Captain Kelly—the boisterous Irishman—clapt
me on the shoulder and almost shouted out his
congratulations in my ear. When I forced him to mention
the name of the lady, he ridiculed my denial—his
forefinger in my ribs—painful as well as undignified.
Who is Captain Kelly, that he should subject me to his familiarities?
But if he was undignified, I flatter myself
that I was not so. ‘Sir, you presume,’ I said, and walked
on, leaving this vulgar fellow roaring with laughter.”</p>

<p>“Psha! Kelly is a nobody,” said Garrick. “You
should not have allowed yourself to be discomposed by
such as he.”</p>

<p>“Nor did I,” cried the other. “But what was I to
think when I had advanced no more than a dozen paces,
and found my hand grasped warmly by Sir John Dingle?—you
know him, Mr. Garrick—I have seen him in
your company—more congratulations—the same attitude,
sir. And then up marches Mr. Sheridan—leaving
his handsome wife—ah, I fear that I joined with all
Bath in being in love with the lovely Miss Linley—and
Mr. Sheridan was wellnigh affronted at my denial. But
that was not all. Up comes Mrs. Cholmondeley in her
chair and tapped for the men to set her down when she
saw me—up went the roof and up went her head, with a
shrill cry of ‘Kendal, you rogue! to tell everyone at the
Wells save only myself that Benedick is to be a married
man!’ And before she had finished her ridicule of my
denial, up struts Mrs. Thrale, her footman behind her
with her spaniel, and down she sinks in a curtsey, fitted
only for a special night in the Rooms, and her ‘Happy
man!’ came with a flick of her fan; and she, too, named
Mrs. Nash! And that was not the last—I saw them
hurrying up to me from all sides—ladies with smiles,
and gentlemen with smirks—fingers twitching for my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
ribs—down they flowed upon me! I ask you, Lieutenant
Burney, as a naval gentleman, and I am glad to
have the opportunity of hearing your opinion—I ask
you, if I was not justified in turning about and hastening
away—what you nautical gentlemen term ‘cutting
my cable’?”</p>

<p>“Indeed, sir; if I could believe that you gave the
lady no encouragement, I would say that—that—but
no one will convince me that upon some occasion—it
may be forgotten by you—such men of fashion as yourself
soon forget these things, I have heard, though the
unhappy lady treasures them as golden memories—I
say upon some occasion you may have given the Widow
Nash encouragement. You have your reputation as a sly
rogue to maintain, Mr. Kendal,” said young Burney
gravely, as though he were a lawyer being seriously
consulted.</p>

<p>“Fore Gad, sir, I gave her no encouragement,” cried
Mr. Kendal. “I have ever been most cautious, I
swear.”</p>

<p>“Then the greater shame for you, sir,” said Garrick.</p>

<p>The man whom he addressed looked in amazement
first at Garrick, then at Lieutenant Burney—Dr. Burney,
whom he had come to consult, was smiling quite
unnoticed in a corner. His part apparently, was no
more than that of the looker-on at a comedy. His
presence was ignored by the others.</p>

<p>“The more shame—the more—” began the visitor.
“I protest that I scarcely take your meaning, Mr. Garrick.”</p>

<p>“My meaning is plain, sir,” said Garrick firmly,
almost sternly. “I affirm that it lay with you, when
you perceived that the lady was so deeply enamoured
of you—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>“But I did not perceive it—you have my word for
it.”</p>

<p>“Ah, sir,” said Garrick, with the shrug of a Frenchman,
which he had studied for some months in Paris—Mr.
Garrick and Lord Chesterfield had alone mastered
the art. “Ah, sir, we are all men of the world here.
’Twere idle for you to pretend that a gentleman with
the figure of the Belvedere Apollo and the leg of—of—”
he turned to young Burney—“You have seen the proud-stepping
figure-heads of many ships of the line, Mr.
Burney,” he said; “prithee help me out in my search
for—for—the name I am in search of.”</p>

<p>“H’m, let me see—something wooden with a leg to
be proud of?” said the naval gentleman, considering
the matter very earnestly.</p>

<p>“Zounds, sir, I did not make it a condition that it
should be a wooden leg,” cried Garrick.</p>

<p>“I have seen more than one Admiral of the Fleet
mighty proud of a wooden leg, sir,” said Burney. “But
this is beside the question, which I take to be the
responsibility of our good friend here—I hope I don’t
presume, Mr. Kendal—for kindling, albeit unconsciously,
so far as he was concerned—that sacred flame in the
breast of—to name only one out of a score—the lady
whose name he mentioned.”</p>

<p>“You are with me heart and soul, as I felt sure you
would be, Mr. Burney; as a naval officer of judgment
and experience,” cried Garrick, “and so, sir—” he
turned to their visitor—“I cannot doubt that you will
comport yourself as a gentleman of honour in this affair.
Do not allow your yielding to the natural impulse to run
away to weigh too heavily upon you. If your act should
cause you to be referred to with reprobation, not to say
scorn, by the ladies or gentlemen of fashion who are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
certain to espouse the cause of the lady, your subsequent
conduct will show them that they mistook your character.
And I promise you that should you receive a
challenge from any of the lady’s admirers—those whose
prayers she rejected because her heart was set on a
gentleman who was worthy of her choice—I think you
can afford to ignore them, having won the prize. Ah,
sir, is there not a poet who says that every man that
lives has a good angel and a bad one contending for
dominion over him? That is the truth, Mr. Kendal,
and I see that your good angel is none other than the
lady whose name I reckon too sacred to pass our lips at
such a time as this. Ah, sir, think of her, and let your
mind go back to the days of your happy boyhood, and
say if the mother at whose knees you knelt did not resemble
her. The affection of a son for his mother—let
that plead for the lady who esteems you with more than
a mother’s love.”</p>

<p>He had laid his hand on the poor gentleman’s
shoulder, and was looking into his face, while the tears
stood in his eyes, and his voice broke more than once.</p>

<p>And there sat Dr. Burney wiping his eyes, and Lieutenant
Burney blubbering away like any child—the two
accessories to the actor’s farce could not avoid yielding
to the influence of his unparalleled art. Though they
were in his secret, he made fools of them as easily as he
made a fool of the poor gentleman who was presumably
his victim. And they had no feeling of being ashamed
of yielding to his powers. He could do anything that
he pleased with them. He could do anything he pleased
with the multitudes before whom he acted. He was
the master of their emotions for the time being. He
played upon their passions as though every passion was
a puppet and the strings in his own hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p>The scene ended by Mr. Garrick’s victim groping
through his tears for Mr. Garrick’s hand. He
grasped it emotionally, and though for some moments
he was too greatly overcome to be able to utter a word,
yet at last he managed to blurt out with affecting incoherence
a few phrases.</p>

<p>“Say no more—say no more, sir,” he muttered. “I
have a heart—a heart! I give you my word, whether
you believe me or not, that I had no notion—but you
have shown me what ’tis to be a woman. Oh, sir, there
is no sweeter sex in the world! Deception! how a
man’s own heart may deceive him—ay, up to a certain
point—but then—ah, you have taught me—but are you
sure that the lady—what—have we not being going
ahead too fast? What—what; are you convinced?”</p>

<p>“You may take my word for it, sir,” replied Garrick.
“There are signs that all who run may read. What,
do you suppose that all those persons of quality whose
names you mentioned just now as having offered you
their felicitations—do you suppose that they could all
be in error?”</p>

<p>“Of course not—they must have seen—well, more
than I saw,” said the man. “Matrimony! Lud! if an
angel had come down to tell me that I should be contemplating
such a change of life—and at my time of life
too!—I should have—”</p>

<p>“What an angel may fail to convince a man of, a
woman may succeed in doing, Mr. Kendal,” said Garrick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
sententiously. “But do not talk of your time of
life as if you were an old or even a middle-aged man,
sir. To do so were to make Dr. Burney and myself feel
patriarchs.”</p>

<p>The mention of Dr. Burney seemed to cause the man
to recollect how it was he came to be in Dr. Burney’s
house. He turned to Burney, saying:</p>

<p>“Dear sir, I pray that you will look on my visit with
lenient eyes. I admit that I came hither to be advised
by you—my friend, Mr. Fulke Greville, holds your
opinion in the highest esteem, as do I, sir; and it was
actually on my mind to ask you if you thought it would
be wiser for me to go abroad for a year or two, or simply
to seek some place of retirement at home—say, Cornwall
or the Hebrides—I gather from the account of Dr.
Johnson’s tour thither that there are many places difficult
of access in the Hebrides—that was on my mind,
Doctor, I blush to acknowledge, so greatly overcome was
I by what had happened at the Wells.”</p>

<p>“Ah, with what great ease a man may slam the door
that shuts out happiness from his life for evermore!”
remarked Garrick.</p>

<p>“Even now—even now I feel timid,” said Mr. Kendal
thoughtfully, and, when he had found which pocket
his handkerchief was in, wiping some dew from his
brow. “The truth is, Doctor, that I have allowed some
people to assume that I am but forty-seven years old,
while as a matter of fact I have been forty-eight for
some time.”</p>

<p>“For some years?” asked young Burney, who did
not know when he should keep silence.</p>

<p>“For some months, sir—only for some months, I give
you my word.”</p>

<p>“Your deception in this matter could only have added<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
to your reputation for accuracy,” said Garrick coolly.
“For I vow that were you to confess that you were
forty-eight, you would find none to believe you.”</p>

<p>The gentleman’s eyes twinkled, he pursed out his lips,
and once again manœuvred to get a full-length view of
himself in the long mirror. He put out his right leg
and assumed the attitude of a dancing master giving
the <i lang="fr">pas</i> for the <i lang="fr">minuet de cour</i>.</p>

<p>“Well, well,” he cried, “if that be your opinion—and
I happen to know that ’tis shared by others—it
might not be unwise to allow the assumption, erroneous
though it be, to continue. We will not undeceive the
good folk. And you do not think that a bachelor of
forty-eight—What is the name of that play of Mr. Sheridan’s
that took the town a year ago—ah, <cite>The School for
Scandal</cite>—you are sure that our friends will not call me—What
was the gentleman’s name?”</p>

<p>“No one who knows how excellent are your principles
will think of you either as Charles or Joseph, Mr. Kendal,”
said Garrick.</p>

<p>“No, no; but the one who was in my mind was
neither of the brothers. I was thinking of—was it not
Sir Peter Teazle?”</p>

<p>Garrick as well as Burney laughed heartily, for the
man at that moment suggested by his attitude and expression
the Sir Peter Teazle of Kina, the actor.</p>

<p>“Make your mind easy on that score, sir,” said Dr.
Burney. “It is not your purpose to wed so skittish a
young person as Lady Teazle. That was where Sir
Peter showed his folly.”</p>

<p>“No, no; Mrs. Nash is more mature, certainly, than
Mrs. Abington looked in the part,” said Mr. Kendal
confidently, and Lieutenant Burney was about to agree<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
with him boisterously, but Garrick did not give him a
chance.</p>

<p>“There is none that will not commend your choice,
Mr. Kendal—ay, sir, and look on you with envy as
well,” he cried.</p>

<p>“There can be no doubt about it,” said Mr. Kendal
doubtfully. “The widow Nash is a monstrous fine
woman.”</p>

<p>“Monstrous, I doubt not,” put in young Burney, now
that he had the chance.</p>

<p>“All that I am uneasy about is the interpretation that
she may put upon your sudden flight,” said Garrick.
“You have, you will readily allow, sir, placed her in a
somewhat difficult position at the Wells. While everyone
who is anyone has been offering you congratulations
upon the match, and a double portion to the lady,
strange inquiries may be made as to your disappearance
from the Wells; and she may not be able to give a satisfactory
explanation at a moment’s notice.”</p>

<p>“Egad! I never thought of that, sir,” said Mr. Kendal,
after a pause. “I fear that I have placed her in
a very awkward position.”</p>

<p>“Ay, sir; and the consequences may be that she will
be snapped up by some adventurous person before you
can put your fate to the test,” said the naval man,
raising a warning finger. “I have heard of ladies
throwing themselves into the arms of the next comer
out of sheer chagrin at being disappointed by the man
on whom they had set their affections.”</p>

<p>“That is a possibility that should not be neglected,”
said Garrick. “But it was only on Monday that you
fled. By rapid posting you may yet prevent such a
calamity.”</p>

<p>He was beginning to tire of his game now that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
had succeeded so well in it and so easily. The fooling
of the man who had so completely succumbed to his art
had no further interest for him. He only wanted to get
rid of him. He was as capricious and as fickle as a
child over the toys of its nursery.</p>

<p>“I shall lose no moment, be assured,” said Mr. Kendal.
“I may still be in time. My hope in this direction
is increased when I remember that the lady has
been a widow for some years—to be exact, without
being uncomplimentary, nine years. I remember when
Mr. Nash died. ’Twas of pleurisy.”</p>

<p>“Do not reckon too confidently on that, sir,” said
young Burney. “Nine years have not passed since she
faced the company at the Wells, every one of which was
surely pointing at her and asking in mute eloquence,
‘What has become of Mr. Kendal?’ But by posting
without delay you may yet retrieve your error. Still, I
confess to you that I have known of a lady who, out of
sheer impatience at the delay of a lover whom she had
hoped to espouse, married his rival after the lapse of
twenty-four hours—ay, and when the belated gentleman
arrived just after the ceremony, he furnished the wedding
party with a succulent feast. She was the Queen
of one of the islands that we visited in the company of
Captain Cook, and the cockswain of our galley kept the
pickled hand of the belated lover for many a day—the
very hand which he had designed to offer the lady.”</p>

<p>“This simple and affecting narrative proves more
eloquently than any phrases of mine could possibly do
how a man may miss the happiness of his life by a
hair’s breadth,” said Garrick. “And the lesson will
not be lost upon you, I am certain, sir.”</p>

<p>“Lud, Mr. Garrick, you do not mean to suggest that—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>“That the lady may make a meal off you on your
late return, sir? Nay, Mr. Kendal. The Wells are
still the Wells, not the South Seas; but on the whole
I am disposed to believe that the scheme of revenge of
the woman scorned is fiercer, though perhaps not, at
first sight, so primeval, in the region of Chalybeate
Waters than in a cannibal island of the South Seas.
Therefore—there is no time to be lost. Fly to your
charmer, sir, and throw yourself at her feet. She may
be thinking over some punishment for your having
placed her in a false position for some days; but do
not mind that. You can always console yourself with
the reflection that a rod in pickle is much more satisfactory
than a hand in pickle. Fly, my dear friend,
fly; every moment is precious. Take my word for it,
joy awaits you at the end of your journey.”</p>

<p>“‘Journeys end in lovers meeting,’” remarked Dr.
Burney, with a slight suggestion of the setting of the
words of the lyric by his old master, Dr. Arne.</p>

<p>At this moment a servant entered the room.</p>

<p>“The Streatham carriage is at the door, sir,” he announced.</p>

<p>Dr. Burney rose from his chair.</p>

<p>“I am forced to leave you, sir,” he said to Mr. Kendal.
“But really there is naught further to consult
on at present, and I know that you are impatient—it
is but natural—to fly to the side of your charmer.”</p>

<p>“I am all impatience, sir; but with what words can
I express my obligation to you, Doctor, for the benefit
of your counsel?” cried Mr. Kendal.</p>

<p>Dr. Burney smiled.</p>

<p>“Nay, dear sir, I am but the lessee of the theatre where
the comedy has been played,” said he; and he had good
reason for feeling that he had defined with accuracy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
the position that he occupied. But Mr. Kendal was
thinking too much about himself and the position he
occupied to appreciate such <i lang="fr">nuances</i>.</p>

<p>“I knew that I was safe in coming to a friend of Mr.
Greville,” he said. “I care not if, as you suggest, you
have become Mr. Garrick’s successor at Drury Lane,
though I thought that Mr. Sheridan—”</p>

<p>“Zounds, sir, you are never going to wait to discuss
theatre matters,” cried Garrick. “Dr. Burney has
been exercising his powers of oratory in vain upon you
for this half hour if you tarry even to thank him. Post,
sir, post at once to Tunbridge Wells, and send Dr.
Burney your thanks when you have put the momentous
question to the lady. Go, sir, without the pause of a
moment, and good luck attend you.”</p>

<p>“Good luck attend you! Keep up your heart, sir:
the lady may refuse you after all,” said young Burney;
but the poor gentleman who was being hurried away
was too much flurried to be able to grasp the young
man’s innuendo, though one could see by the look that
came to his face that he had an uneasy impression that
Lieutenant Burney’s good wishes had not been happily
expressed. The great thing, however, was that he was
at the other side of the door, calling out his obligations
to everyone, and striving to shake hands with them all
at once and yet preserve the security of his hat, which
he had tucked under his arm. So excited was he that
he was only restrained at the last moment from mounting
the Thrales’ carriage which was awaiting Dr. Burney,
and even when his mistake was explained to him,
he took off his hat to the splendid footman who had
guarded the door of the vehicle.</p>

<p>In the room where the comedy had been played, Garrick
and Lieutenant Burney had thrown themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
into chairs with roars of laughter, when Dr. Burney
returned from the hall, carrying his hat and cane. He
was scarcely smiling.</p>

<p>“You have played a pretty prank upon an inoffensive
gentleman, the pair of you!” said he. “I am
ashamed that my house has been used by you for so
base a purpose! The poor gentleman!”</p>

<p>“Psha! my dear Doctor, make your mind easy; the
lady will teach that coxcomb a lesson that will be of
advantage to him for the rest of his life,” said Garrick.
“He has been the laughing-stock of the Wells for the
past fortnight, and no one laughed louder than the
Widow Nash. She will bundle him out of her presence
before he has had time to rise from his marrow-bones—he
does not find the process a rapid one, I assure you.
Oh, he was her <i lang="fr">bête noire</i> even when he was most civil
to her.”</p>

<p>“And it was you who concocted that plot of getting
all your friends—Mrs. Cholmondeley, Mrs. Thrale and
the rest—to make a fool of him, driving him away from
the Wells to encounter a more irresistible pair of mocking
demons in this room!” said Burney. “You cannot
deny it, my friend, I know your tricks but too well.”</p>

<p>“I swear to you that I had no hope of encountering
him in this house, my dear Doctor,” said Garrick. “I
give you my word that I had laid my plans quite differently.
My plot was a far more elaborate one, and Polly
Cholmondeley had agreed to take part in it, as well as
Dick Sheridan. They will be disappointed to learn that
it has miscarried. Who could guess that he should come
to you of all men in the world, Doctor? He has never
been one of your intimates.”</p>

<p>“Only when I was living with Mr. Greville had we
more than a superficial acquaintance,” replied Burney.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
“But that does not make me the less ashamed of having
lent myself to your nefarious project. And you,
James, you threw yourself with gusto into the fooling
of the unhappy man—and woman too—and woman too,
I repeat.”</p>

<p>“Pray do not distress yourself on her account, Doctor.
She will send him off with a flea in his ear by to-morrow
night, and she will take care to pose as the insulted
widow of Mr. Nash, whose memory is dear to
her,” said Garrick.</p>

<p>“Will she, indeed?” said Burney. “David Garrick,
you are the greatest actor that has ever lived in England—probably
in the world—but you are a poor comedian
compared with such as are at work upon our
daily life: we call them Circumstance, and Accident,
and Coincidence. You know the couplet, I doubt not:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">‘Men are the sport of circumstances when</div>
<div class="verse">The circumstances seem the sport of men.’</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">You have sounded the depths of human impulses, so far
as your plummet allows you, and womankind seems to
you an open book—”</p>

<p>“An illuminated missal, with the prayers done in
gold and the Lessons for the day in the most roseate
tint, Doctor.”</p>

<p>“And the Responses all of a kind—the same in one
book as another? But I make bold to believe, my
friend, that every woman is a separate volume, of which
only one copy has been printed; and, moreover, that
every separate volume of woman is sealed, so that anyone
who fancies he knows all that is bound up between
the covers, when he has only glanced at the binding,
makes a mistake.”</p>

<p>“Admirably put, sir, and, I vow, with fine philosophy,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
said Garrick. “But what imports this nomination
of a woman at the present moment, Doctor?”</p>

<p>“Its import is that you are over sanguine in your
assurance that Mrs. Nash, widow, will reject Mr. Kendal,
bachelor, when he offers her his hand after a dusty
journey; and so good day to you, David Garrick, and
I pray you to spend the rest of the day in the study of
the history of those women who have opened the leaves
of their lives a little way before the eyes of mankind.”</p>

<p>He had left the room and was within the waiting carriage
and driving away before his son remarked:</p>

<p>“Mr. Garrick, it seems to me that my good father has
spoken the wisest words that you or I have heard to-day
or for many a day.”</p>

<p>“And i’ faith, James, it seems to me that that remark
of yours is the second wisest that has been uttered in
this room,” said Garrick.</p>

<p>He went away without a further word—without even
taking his leave of the two young women and their stepmother,
who herself had been a widow before she had
married Dr. Burney. He had once believed that nothing
a woman—young or old—could do would surprise
him; for some reason or other he was not now quite so
confident as he had been. But he certainly did not
think that one of the greatest surprises of the century
should be due to the demure young woman who seemed
the commonplace daughter of a very ordinary household,
and who at the moment of his departure was darning
a small hole in a kitchen table-cloth, under the superintendence
of her admirable stepmother.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p>In the course of the morning Esther, the married
daughter of the Burney family, called at the house
in St. Martin’s Street. Esther, or as she was usually
alluded to by her sisters, Hetty or Hettina, was handsome
and accomplished. She had been married for
some years to her cousin, Charles Rousseau Burney, who
was a musician, and they lived and enjoyed living in an
atmosphere of music. Her father took care that she
was never likely to be asphyxiated; their atmosphere
would never become attenuated so long as they lived,
as they did, close to St. Martin’s Street. He was well
aware of the fact that his Hetty’s duets with her husband—“matrimonial
duets” they were called by Fanny
in some of her letters—and also with her sister Charlotte,
served to attract many distinguished visitors and
profitable patrons to his house; he never forgot that
profitable patrons and patronesses are always attracted
by distinguished visitors. When one finds oneself in
the company of distinguished people, one naturally
feels a distinguished person also.</p>

<p>Moreover, Dr. Burney knew perfectly well that when
ambitious patrons and patronesses were made aware of
the success which he had achieved in respect of his
daughters, they were all ready to implore of him to
spare some of his valuable time to give lessons to themselves,
seeing no reason why, with his assistance, they
should not reach the level of his two musical daughters.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
He conducted his teaching on the principle which brings
fortunes to the Parisian modiste, who takes good care
that her mannequins are good-looking and of a fine
figure, knowing that the visitors to the showrooms have
no doubt, no matter how little Nature has done for
their own features or figures, that in the robes of the
mannequins they will appear equally fascinating.</p>

<p>The adoption of this system in the Burney household
operated extremely well, and Dr. Burney had for
several years enjoyed the proceeds of his cultivation of
the musical tastes of the most influential clientèle in
London. In addition, the greatest singers in Europe,
knowing that there was always an influential <i lang="fr">assistance</i>
to be found at Dr. Burney’s little concerts in St. Martin’s
Street, were greatly pleased to contribute to the
entertainment, for love, what they were in the habit of
receiving large sums for from an impresario. Those
Italian operatic artists most notorious for the extravagance
of their demands when appearing in public, were
pushing each other aside, so to speak, to be allowed to
sing at Dr. Burney’s, and really upon more than one
occasion the contest between the generosity of a pair of
the most distinguished of these singers must have been
somewhat embarrassing to Dr. Burney. They were
clearly singing against each other; and one of them, who
invariably received fifty guineas for every contribution
she made to a programme in public, insisted on singing
no fewer than five songs, “all for love” (and to prove
her superiority to her rival), upon a certain occasion
at the Burneys’; so that really the little company
ran a chance of being suffocated beneath the burden of
flowers, as it were—the never-ending <i lang="it">fioriture</i> of these
generous artists—and Dr. Burney found himself in the
position of the lion-tamer who runs a chance of being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
overwhelmed by the caresses of the carnivora who rush
to lick his hands.</p>

<p>The result of all this was extremely gratifying, and
eminently profitable. Had Dr. Burney not been a great
musician and shown by the publication of the first
volume of the greatest History of Music the world had
yet received, that he was worthy of being placed in the
foremost ranks of scientific musicians, he would have
run a chance of being placed only a little higher than
the musical Cornelys of Soho Square, who gave their
concerts, and entertained their friends, and made quite
a reputation for some years before bankruptcy overtook
them and the precincts of the Fleet became their
headquarters.</p>

<p>And now the beautiful Esther Burney was toying
with the contents of her sister Fanny’s work-basket,
talking about her husband and his prospects, and inquiring
what Mr. Garrick and James had to talk about
in the room downstairs.</p>

<p>“Pray speak in French to Fanny,” said Mrs. Burney.
“I cannot get Lottie and Susan to do so as frequently
as I could wish. You must remember that poor Fanny
has had none of your advantages, and I do not want
her to be talked of as the dunce of the family. She
really is not a dunce, you know; in spite of her bad
sight she really has done some very pretty sewing.”</p>

<p>“I have seen it,” said Esther. “She works very
neatly—more neatly than any of us.”</p>

<p>Fanny blushed and smiled her thanks to her sister
for the compliment.</p>

<p>“What else is there left for me to do but to give
all my attention to my needle?” she said. “I constantly
feel that I am the dunce of the family—you are
all so clever.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>“It is well for many families that they include one
useful member,” said her stepmother in a way that
suggested her complete agreement with the girl’s confession
that she was the dunce of the family. A
mother’s acknowledgment that a girl is either useful or
good-natured is practically an announcement that she
is neither pretty nor accomplished.</p>

<p>“And Fanny has many friends,” continued Mrs.
Burney indulgently.</p>

<p>“Which shows how kind people are, even to a dunce,”
said Fanny, not bitterly, but quite good-humouredly.</p>

<p>“But I am not sure that she should spend so much
of her time writing to Mr. Crisp,” said the elder Mrs.
Burney to the younger.</p>

<p>“Oh, poor Daddy Crisp!” cried Fanny. “Pray,
mother, do not cut him off from his weekly budget of
news. If I fail to send him a letter he is really disconsolate.
’Tis my letters that keep him still in touch with
the life of the town.”</p>

<p>“Well, well, my dear Fanny, I shall not deprive you
of your Daddy Crisp,” said her stepmother. “Poor
Mr. Crisp must not be left to the tender mercies of
Susan or Lottie. He is most hospitable, and his house
at Chessington makes a pleasant change for us now
and again, and he took a great fancy to you from the
first.”</p>

<p>“Daddy Crisp was always Fanny’s special friend,”
said Esther. “And I am sure that it is good practice
for Fanny to write to him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, she has long ago given up that childish nonsense,”
cried the mother. “Poor Fanny made a pretty
bonfire of her scribblings, and she has shown no weakness
in that way since she took my advice in regard to
them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>Fanny was blushing furiously and giving all her
attention to her work.</p>

<p>“She has still a sense of the guilt that attaches to the
writing of stories, though I am sure that no one in this
house remembers it against her,” said Esther with a
laugh, as Fanny’s blushes increased. “But indeed I
had not in my mind Mr. Crisp’s advantage to her in this
way, but only in regard to her correspondence. She
has become quite an expert letter-writer since he induced
her to send him her budget, and indeed I think
that good letter-writing is as much of an accomplishment
in these careless days as good singing—that is
ordinary good singing—the good singing that we hear
from some of father’s pupils—Queenie Thrale, <i lang="fr">par
exemple</i>!”</p>

<p>“Your father is a good teacher, but the best teacher
in the world cannot endow with a good singing-voice
anyone who has not been so gifted by Nature,” said the
elder lady. “’Tis somewhat different, to be sure, in
regard to correspondence, and I do not doubt that
Fanny’s practice in writing to good Mr. Crisp will one
day cause her to be regarded as one of the best letter-writers
in the family, and that is something. It is a
ladylike accomplishment, and one that is worth excelling
in; it gives innocent pleasure to so many of her friends
who live at a distance; and your father can always obtain
plenty of franks, Mr. Charmier and Mr. Thrale are very
obliging.”</p>

<p>Fanny was a little fidgety while her eldest sister and
her stepmother were discussing her in a tone of indulgence
which was more humiliating than open reprobation
would have been. But she knew that the truth was,
that from her earliest years she was looked on as the
dunce of the family, and she was so morbidly self-conscious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
that she was quite ready to accept their estimate of
her. The silent member of a musical family soon finds
out how she is looked on by the others; not with unkindness—quite
the contrary—but only as if she were to be
slightly pitied for her deficiency. But she had a secret
or two, the treasuring of which in her heart prevented
her from having any feeling of humiliation in the presence
of her splendid sister, whom all the world sought to
attract to their houses, especially when there were guests
anxious to be entertained by the sweet singing of a handsome
young woman with a very presentable young husband.
Fanny had her secrets and cherished them with a
fearful joy, for she knew that any day might remove
either or both of them, and then there would be nothing
left for her in the household but to put her heart into her
needlework. But one cannot do needlework without
needles, and if she were to put her heart into her work,
and if every needle had a point, the result would, she
knew, be a good many prickings.</p>

<p>She trusted that she might never be condemned to put
her heart into her needlework.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p>Then Lieutenant Burney sauntered into the room
and greeted Esther; but when Fanny inquired
with some eagerness what had been the result of Mr.
Garrick’s fooling of poor Mr. Kendal, James was by no
means so glib or amusing as Fanny expected him to be.</p>

<p>“Psha!” he cried; “that Mr. Kendal is not worth
powder and shot—at least not the weight of metal that
Mr. Garrick can discharge—not in a broadside—Mr. Garrick
is not given to broadsides—they are too clumsy for
him—he is like Luke Boscawen, our chief gunner; he had
a contempt for what he was used to term a blustering
broadside, having a liking only for the working of his
little brass swivel. He could do anything that he pleased
with his little swivel. ‘Ping!’ it would go, when he
had squinted along the sights, and the object he aimed
at half a mile away—sometimes so small that we could
scarce see it from our foretop—down it went. Boscawen
could do what he pleased with it—the blunt nose of
a whale rising to spout a mile away—the stem of a cocoa-nut
palm on one of the islands when we were not sure
of the natives and there was no time to climb the tree—that
is the marksmanship of Mr. Garrick, and your Mr.
Kendal was not worthy of an exercise of so much skill.”</p>

<p>“Nobody seems too insignificant to be made a fool of
by Mr. Garrick,” said Mrs. Burney. “He is as happy
when he has made a gruesome face and frightened a maid
with a mop at the doorstep, as when he has stricken us
with awe when the ghost enters in <cite>Hamlet</cite>, or when Macbeth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
declaims of the horror of the curse of sleeplessness
that has been cast on him. That is why I said before he
arrived that I was not sure that his influence upon you
all is for good. He makes one lose one’s sense of the
right proportions and realities of life. Now is not that
so, Hetty? I make no appeal to Fanny, for I know that
she has ever been devoted to Mr. Garrick. Is it not true
that she was used to frighten poor Lottie before she was
ten by showing how Mr. Garrick frowned as the Duke of
Gloster?”</p>

<p>“I know that Fanny murdered us all in turn in our
beds, assuring us that we were the Princes in the Tower,
or some less real characters invented by herself,” said
Esther. “But indeed if James tells us that Mr. Garrick’s
gun practice smashed the cocoa-nut that serves
Mr. Kendal as a head, I should not grieve. Tell us what
happened, James.”</p>

<p>“Oh, ’twas naught worth words to describe,” said
James. “The man came to take counsel of Daddy in
regard to a jest that Mr. Garrick had, unknown to his
victim, played off upon him, and Mr. Garrick so worked
upon him that Daddy had no chance to speak. But
Mr. Garrick made fools of us as well, for I give you my
word, though we were in with him in his jest, he had us
blubbering like boobies when he laid his hand on the
fellow’s shoulder and spoke nonsense in a voice quivering
and quavering as though he were at the point of breaking
down.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burney the elder shook her head.</p>

<p>“That is what I do not like—that trifling with sacred
things,” she said. “’Tis not decent in a private house—I
would not tolerate it even in a playhouse, and I see
that you are of my opinion, James, though you may have
been dragged into the abetting of Mr. Garrick in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
whatever mad scheme he had set himself upon perfecting.”</p>

<p>“Oh, for that matter we are all sorry when we have
been merry at the expense of another, even though he be
an elderly coxcomb such as that Mr. Kendal,” said
James. “But enough—more than enough—of coxcomb
Kendal! Tell us of the Duchess’s concert, Hetty.
Were the matrimonial duets as successful as usual?”</p>

<p>Esther, who had been disappointed that her stepmother
had not yet said a word about the concert of the
previous night given by the Dowager Duchess of Portland,
at which she and her husband had performed,
brightened up at her brother’s question.</p>

<p>“The concert was well enough,” she replied with an
affectation of carelessness. “’Twas no better than many
that have taken place under this roof. Her Grace and
her grandees were very kind to us—we had enough
plaudits to turn the head of Gabrielli herself.”</p>

<p>“Oh, the Gabrielli’s head has been turned so frequently
that one can never tell when it sits straight on
her shoulders,” said James.</p>

<p>“She was very civil to us last evening,” said Esther.
“Indeed, she was civil to everyone until the enchanter
Rauzzini sang the solo from <cite>Piramo e Tisbe</cite> and swept
the company off their feet. The poor Gabrielli had no
chance against Rauzzini.”</p>

<p>“Especially in a company that numbered many
ladies,” said James, with a laugh. “You remember
what Sir Joshua told us that Dr. Goldsmith had once
said of Johnson?—that in his argument he was like the
highwayman: when his pistol missed fire he knocked one
down with the butt.”</p>

<p>“I heard that upon one occasion Dr. Johnson knocked
a man down with a heavy book, but I cannot imagine his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
ever firing a pistol,” remarked Mrs. Burney, who had
been used, when the wife of a straightforward merchant
of Lynn, to take every statement literally, and had not
yet become accustomed to the involved mode of speaking
of the brilliant young Burneys.</p>

<p>“You mean that Rauzzini—I don’t quite perceive
what you do mean by your reference to Dr. Goldsmith’s
apt humour,” said Esther.</p>

<p>“I only mean that among such a company as assembled
at the Duchess’s, if he missed fire with his singing, he
glanced around with those dark eyes of his and the
ladies went down before him by the score,” replied
James. “Do not I speak the truth, Fanny?” he added,
turning quickly to where Fanny was searching with her
short-sighted eyes close to her work-basket for some
material that seemed to be missing.</p>

<p>But she had clearly heard her brother’s question, for
she did not need to raise her head or to ask him to repeat
it.</p>

<p>“Oh, we are all the slaves of the nobil’ signor,” she
said, and continued her search in the basket.</p>

<p>“From the way he talked to us last night it might be
fancied that it was he who was the captive,” said Esther.</p>

<p>“And I do not doubt that he is living in a state of
constant captivity,” laughed James. “Ay, or I should
rather term it inconstant captivity, for I dare swear that
those black eyes of his do a deal of roving in the course
of a year—nay, in the course of a day. These singer
fellows feel that ’tis due to their art, this moving the
hearts of their hearers, by moving their own affections
from heart to heart. The Rauzzini is, I fancy, like one
of the splendid butterflies we came upon in the Straits,
fluttering from flower to flower.”</p>

<p>“I have heard no stories of his inconstancy, even from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
the Gabrielli when she was most envious of his plaudits,”
said Esther, and she glanced at her sister, who was earnestly
threading a needle.</p>

<p>“You goose!” cried James to Esther. “Do you suppose
that Gabrielli would tell you anything so greatly
complimentary to him? In these days you cannot pay a
man a greater compliment than to compare him to the
fickle butterfly. You see that suggests a welcome from
every flower.”</p>

<p>“I protest that it is to sailors I have heard most compliments
of that sort paid,” laughed Esther, and then,
putting herself in a singing attitude before him, she
lilted most delightfully:</p>

<p>“Now be advised by me, dear James, and do not attribute
even in a cynical way, the vice of inconstancy
to a singer, until you have left the Navy.”</p>

<p>“I did not allude to it as a vice—rather as a virtue,”
said James. “Just think of the hard fate of any girl to
have such a person as a singer ever by her side!”</p>

<p>He easily evaded the rush down upon him made by
Hetty, and used his nautical skill to sail to the windward
of her, as it were, until he had reached the door,
whence he sent a parting shot at her.</p>

<p>“You surely don’t think that I hinted that your
spouse was a singer,” he cried. “A singer! Oh, lud!
I should be swaying away on all top ropes if I were to
call the matrimonial duets singing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>He gave a shout of laughter as he caught the ball of
wool which Esther threw at him, having picked it up
from her stepmother’s work-table. He returned it with
a better aim, and before his sister could get a hand on it,
he had shut the door, only opening it a little space a few
seconds later to put in his head with a mocking word,
withdrawing it at once, and then his foot was heard upon
the stair, while he gave a sailor’s version of Mr. Garrick’s
patriotic naval song:</p>

<p>“He has gone before I had a chance of asking him to
take a message to the cheesemonger,” said Mrs. Burney,
calling out to him while she hurried after him out of the
room.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p>The moment the two sisters were alone, the elder
said quickly in a low voice, leaning across the
table:</p>

<p>“We had a long talk with Signor Rauzzini, my dearest
Fanny. I could not, of course, tell you before mother.”</p>

<p>“You mentioned his name; but were you discreet?”
said Fanny. “I think mother felt that you were going
too far when you referred to his eyes. Mother most
surely believes that the dark eyes of an Italian form a
topic that should not be discussed except by our elders,
and then only with bated breath and a fearful glance
around lest a word should be overheard.”</p>

<p>“His eyes—you know his eyes, Fanny?”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Fanny, with an inflection that was between
a sigh and a moan.</p>

<p>“You should have seen them while he spoke of you,”
said Esther. “Talk of flashes of lightning!—Dear
child, it seemed so singular to us that a mite like you
should inspire a grand passion in such a man. You are
not angry with us, I know, but it was so indeed.”</p>

<p>“Why should I feel angry with you for feeling just
what I do myself, only more intensely,” said Fanny.
“’Tis one of the greatest mysteries of life—the only
mystery of life that I have yet faced—why a man who
is as handsome as an archangel, and who possesses a
voice that an archangel might envy, should so much as
glance at an insignificant young woman like myself!
Oh! ’tis no wonder that the notion amused you, dear
Hetty.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>“It only diverted us for a time, I assure you, my
Fanny; it did not take us very long to perceive how it
was no laughing matter, but, on the contrary, a very
serious matter. Signor Rauzzini is, as I said, an enchanter,
but do you not think that ’tis somewhat dangerous
to—to—”</p>

<p>“To play with fire? That is what is on your mind,
dear—to allow the fire of his Roman eyes to play about
me? Dangerous? I admit that wherever there is fire
there is danger, especially when it flashes from such
eyes.”</p>

<p>“I am glad that you need no warning, child. As your
elder sister I am pleased that—that—but no one in the
house seems to think for a moment that the favour he
has so distinctly shown to you can mean anything. Indeed,
until last night, neither Charles nor I could
believe—”</p>

<p>Fanny laughed, half closing her short-sighted eyes
with a curious expression as she looked at her sister.</p>

<p>“It is only natural, my dear Hettina,” she said.
“Have I ever ventured to suggest that I am other than
the dunce of the family?”</p>

<p>“You have always been absurdly humble, Fanny, and
I have never hesitated to say so,” cried Esther. “I am
sure that none of us could have made up such clever
little pieces to act as you did when we were children.
And as for writing, could any of us have so neatly copied
out the padre’s History as you did last year! Mr. Crisp,
too—he never takes pleasure in any letters of the family
except what you write for him.”</p>

<p>“All perfectly true, my Hettina,” replied Fanny.
“But where am I when the house is filled with visitors?
You know that I am nobody—that all I pray for with
all my heart is that no one will take any notice of me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
and I think I can say that my prayer is nearly always
granted.”</p>

<p>“That is because you are so dreadfully—so absurdly
shy,” said Esther. “You are the little mouse that is
evermore on the look out for a hole into which you can
creep and be safe from the observation of all eyes. You
are ever trying to escape, unless when Mr. Garrick is
here.”</p>

<p>“Dear Hettina, I know my place—that is all. I have
weak eyes, but quick ears, and I have heard strangers
ask, when they have heard you sing and Susan play, who
the little short-sighted girl in the corner is and what she
means to do for the entertainment of the company.
When they are assured that I am one of the clever
Burney family they whisper an incredulous ‘No?’ They
cannot believe that so insignificant a person as myself
can be one of you.”</p>

<p>“’Tis your morbid self-consciousness, Fanny, that
suggests so much to you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no; I was the dunce from the first. You know
that while you could read any book with ease when you
were six, I did not even know my letters when I was
eight. Don’t you remember how James made a jest of
my thirst for knowledge by pretending to teach me the
alphabet with the page turned upside down? And when
you had gone to school at Paris and it was my turn as the
next eldest, the wise padre perceived in a moment that
the money would be much better spent upon Susan and
Lottie, and they went to be educated while I remained
at home in ignorance? The dear padre was right: he
knew that I should have been miserable among bright
girls away from home.”</p>

<p>There was a pause before the elder sister said quite
pathetically:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>“My poor Fanny! I wonder if you have not been
treated shabbily among us.”</p>

<p>“Not I, my Hettina. I have always been treated
fairly. I have had as many treats as any of you; when
you were learning so much in Paris I have been learning
quite a number of things at home. And one of the most
important things I learned was that so brilliant a person
as Signor Rauzzini could never be happy if married to
so insignificant a person as Fanny Burney.”</p>

<p>Esther gave a little sigh of relief.</p>

<p>“Indeed I think that your conclusion is a right one,
dear,” she said. “We both came to the conclusion—Charles
and I—that it would be a huge misfortune if
you should allow yourself to be attracted by the glamour
that attaches to the appearance of such a man as the
Rauzzini, though, mind you, I believe that he honestly
fancies himself in love with you—oh, he made no disguise
of it in talking with us last night. But I hoped
that you would be sensible.”</p>

<p>“Oh, in the matter of sense I am the equal of anyone
in the family,” said Fanny, laughing. “That I mean
to make my one accomplishment—good sense. That is
the precious endowment of the dunce of the clever
family—good sense; the one who stands next to the
dunce in the lack of accomplishments should be endowed
with good nature. Good sense and good nature go hand
in hand in plain grey taffeta, not down the primrose
paths of life, but along the King’s highway of every day,
where they run no chance of jostling the simple foot-passengers
or exciting the envy of any by the flaunting
of feathers in their face. Good sense and good nature
are best satisfied when they attract no attention, but
pass on to obscurity, smiling at the struggle of others to
be accounted persons of importance.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then you have indeed made up your mind to marry
Mr. Barlowe?” cried Esther.</p>

<p>Fanny laughed enigmatically.</p>

<p>“Does it not mean rather that I have made up my
mind not to marry Mr. Barlowe?” she cried.</p>

<p>Esther looked puzzled: she was puzzled, and that was
just what Fanny meant her to be.</p>

<p>But then she looked piqued, as elder sisters do when
puzzled by the words or the acts of the younger. What
business have younger sisters puzzling their elders?
Their doing so suggests pertness when the elders are unmarried,
but sheer insubordination when they are married;
and Esther was by no means willing at any time to
abrogate the privileges of her position as a married
woman.</p>

<p>“I protest that I do not understand your meaning,
Fanny,” she said, raising her chin in a way that gave
her head a dignified poise. There was also a chill dignity
in the tone of her voice.</p>

<p>“Dear Hettina, I ask your pardon,” cried Fanny
quickly. “I fear that I replied to you with a shameful
unreasonableness. But indeed I am not sure that you
had reason on your side when you assumed that because
I was ready to acknowledge that it would not mean happiness
to our dear Signor Rauzzini to marry an insignificant
person like myself, I was therefore prepared to
throw myself into the arms of Mr. Barlowe.”</p>

<p>“I fancied that—that—but you may have another
suitor in your mind whose name you have not mentioned
to anyone.”</p>

<p>“Why should it be necessary for me to have a suitor
of any kind? Is it not possible to conceive of the existence
of a young woman without a row of suitors in the
background? I admit that the ‘Odyssey’ of Homer—you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
remember how I used to listen to your reading of
Mr. Broome’s translation to mother—would be shorn of
much of its interest but for that background of suitors
in one of the last books, but—well, my dear sister, I
hold that the alternative song of life to the matrimonial
duet is the spinster’s solo, and it does not seem to me to
be quite devoid of interest.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I took it for granted—” began Esther, when
Fanny broke in upon her.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know what all the happily wedded ones take
for granted,” she cried. “You assume that the wedded
life is the only one worth living; but as we are told in
the Bible that there is one glory of the sun and another
of the moon, so I hold that I am justified in believing
that if matrimony be celestial, spinsterhood is terrestrial,
but a glory all the same, and not unattractive to me. I
may be wise enough to content myself with the subdued
charm of moonlight if it so be that I am shut off from
the midday splendour of matrimony.”</p>

<p>Esther did not laugh in the least as did her sister
when she had spoken with an air of finality. She only
made a little motion with her shoulders suggesting a
shrug, while she said:</p>

<p>“I hope you will succeed in convincing mother that
your views are the best for the household; but I think
you will have some difficulty in doing so, considering
what a family of girls we are.”</p>

<p>“I do not doubt that mother will be on the side of
immediate matrimony and poor Mr. Barlowe,” said
Fanny.</p>

<p>“Why poor Mr. Barlowe?” cried Esther. “He is a
young man of excellent principles, and he has never
given his parents a day’s trouble. It is understood that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
if he marries sensibly he will be admitted to a partnership
in the business, so that—”</p>

<p>“Principles and a partnership make for matrimonial
happiness, I doubt not,” said Fanny. “And I doubt
not that Dr. Fell had both excellent principles and an
excellent practice; still someone has recorded in deathless
verse that she—I assume the sex—did not like that
excellent man.”</p>

<p>“And you do not like Mr. Barlowe on the same mysterious
grounds?” said Hetty.</p>

<p>“Nay, I am not so unreasonable, I hope,” replied
Fanny. “But—but—dear sister, I remember how I
thought that the song of the linnet which was in our
little garden at Lynn was the loveliest strain of the grove,
and such was my belief until I awoke one night at Chessington
and heard the nightingale.”</p>

<p>“You are puzzling—singularly puzzling to-day,” said
Esther frowning. “You have started two or three mystifying
parables already. You told me some time ago as
a great secret that you had been renewing your story-writing,
in spite of your having burnt all that you had
written for our edification—all that story—what was its
name? The heroine was one Caroline Evelyn. You
were ever an obedient child, or you would not have sacrificed
your offspring at the bidding of our new mother,
though the advice that she gave you was good, if you
have not quite adhered to it. Novel writing is not for
young ladies any more than novel reading, and certainly
talking in parables is worse still. Well, I have no more
time to spend over your puzzles.”</p>

<p>“You would not find their solution to repay you, my
dear,” said Fanny.</p>

<p>“Still, I am pleased to learn that you take a sensible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
view of Signor Rauzzini and his heroics—but, indeed, I
cannot see that Mr. Barlowe should not be considered,
with his prospects—his father is a mercer in gold and
silver lace, as you know—”</p>

<p>“I have heard so—it is a profitable trade, I believe.”</p>

<p>“None more so. It is impossible to believe that a
time will ever come when gold and silver lace will cease
to be worn by gentlemen.”</p>

<p>“That would be an evil day for England as well as
for Messieurs Barlowe, <i lang="fr">père et fils</i>. But thank heaven it
is not yet in sight. Good morning, dear sister; and be
assured you have my thanks for your advice. But mind
you, keep my little secret about the writing. Good-bye.
You can face mother boldly, knowing that you have
carried out her commission to the letter, and very neatly
and discreetly into the bargain.”</p>

<p>“I would not have done so if her views had not been
mine also; as for your writing—you may depend on my
keeping your secret. But you will have to get the
padre’s permission to have it printed—that’s something
still in the far future, I suppose;”—and the elder sister
stooped to kiss the younger—Fanny was not up to the
shoulder of the beautiful and stately Esther.</p>

<p>And so they parted.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p>Fanny Burney had been forced, for the first
time, to make her sister aware of the fact that she
knew she was looked on as the dunce of the brilliant
Burney family. She could see that her doing so had
startled her sister, for neither Esther nor any of the
other girls had ever suggested to her that they thought
of her as being on a different level from themselves,
though it was tacitly allowed that it was a great pity
that Fanny did not emulate them in taking pains to shine
as it was expected the children of that estimable master
of music, Dr. Burney, should shine, so as to make the
house in that narrow little street off Leicester Fields
attractive to its many distinguished visitors.</p>

<p>Fanny had truly defined her place in the household.
She had recognized her place for several years; but there
was not the least suggestion of rancour in her tone when
talking to her brilliant elder sister, for the simple reason
that there was no bitterness in her heart against any
member of the family for being cleverer than herself.
Fanny took pride in the accomplishments of her sisters,
and was quite content with her position in relation to
them. She got on well with all of them, because she
was fond of them all, and they were all fond of her. She
had not rebelled when her father had sent her younger
sisters to be educated in Paris, and had allowed her to
pick up her own education as best she might in his own
library; and it had been a great happiness to her to be
allowed the privilege of copying out for the press the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
first volume of her father’s “History of Music.” It was
her stepmother who, finding out that Fanny had what
Mrs. Burney called “a taste for writing,” had suggested
that that was the legitimate channel in which such a
taste should flow; and it was her stepmother who had
induced her to make a bonfire of all her own writings—the
scribblings of her girlhood that represented the
foolish errant flow of her “taste for writing”; and
now and again she had a consciousness of her own duplicity
in failing to resist the impulse that had come upon
her to do some more of what her mother termed her
“girlish scribbling.”</p>

<p>One of the guilty secrets that Fanny cherished was
that when it was believed she was writing her long letters
to her old friend Mr. Crisp, she had been composing a
novel which was now about to be given to the world;
the second was that Signor Rauzzini, the handsome young
Roman singer with whom half the fashionable ladies of
the town were in love, was in love with her.</p>

<p>These were two secrets worth the cherishing, she knew;
and the thought of them more than compensated her for
the reflection that she was the dunce of the family, and
that the unconscious tone of patronage adopted toward
her by her elder sister and the dreadful compliments
paid to her plain sewing, as though plain sewing represented
the highest hopes that could reasonably be entertained
in regard to her, were only to be looked for in the
circumstances.</p>

<p>The two secrets were closely bound up together, she
knew. She had the deepest affection for Signor Rauzzini.
How could she fail to return the feeling which
the whisper of his musical voice had told her he had
conceived for her? He loved her in spite of the fact
that she was the least attractive member of the family—in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
spite of the fact that half the town was at his feet, and
that he might have made his choice from among the best.
He had chosen her whom no one else had ever noticed,
with the exception of her father’s old friend, Mr. Crisp,
and—oh, yes (she laughed now, perceiving that she had
done an injustice to the other person who had been attracted
to her—mainly, she thought, on account of her
reputation for plain sewing)—a young man named
Thomas Barlowe, the excellent son of the well-known
mercer of gold and silver lace, in the Poultry!</p>

<p>Thinking of young Mr. Barlowe by the side of Signor
Rauzzini, Fanny laughed again. She had so restricted
an opinion of her own attractiveness that the tears actually
came into her eyes for having given that derisive
laugh as she compared the two young men; and she felt
that she had been grossly ungrateful to young Mr. Barlowe;
for even young Mr. Barlowe had a right to look
above her level for a wife. As the daughter of a simple
music master with a large family she could have no
endowment so far as worldly goods were concerned; and
she knew that the practical parents of young business
men, as a rule, looked for their sons to marry, if not
great fortunes, at least young women with a few thousands
to their names.</p>

<p>She felt that she had treated the condescending young
Mr. Barlowe very badly in laughing at the poor figure
he cut by the side of the angelic Roman singer—she had
failed to resist the temptation to call Signor Rauzzini
angelic in one of her letters to Mr. Crisp—and now, in
thinking of Mr. Barlowe as a very worthy young man,
she was unconsciously relegating him to a hopeless position
as a lover. It is not the very worthy young men
who are beloved by young women of a romantic temperament:
if it were there would be very few romances left.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
But little Miss Burney desired only to ease the twinges
of her conscience for having laughed at the thought of
young Tommy Barlowe; and she thought that she had
done the right thing in assuring herself that he was a
very worthy person.</p>

<p>And then she thought no more about him. She had a
feeling that to give another thought to him when she
had such a man as Signor Rauzzini to think about, would
be a constructive act of treason in regard to Rauzzini.
She had received many hints from her stepmother to the
effect that all the family considered her to be a very
fortunate young woman (all things taken into account)
in having a chance of marrying the Thomas who seemed
ready to pay his addresses to her; but though quite submissive
to her stepmother in household matters, she was
ready to face her with the “Never!” of the avowed rebel
in the matter of consenting to wed the highly approved
Thomas, and so she dismissed him from her thoughts, in
favour of the man whom she loved.</p>

<p>But thinking of the man whom she loved was by no
means equivalent to passing into a region of unalloyed
happiness. She had mystified her sister by the way in
which she had spoken about Signor Rauzzini, and the
seal had been put upon the mystery by her frank
acknowledgment that she did not think a union between
so distinguished a man as Rauzzini and so insignificant
a person as herself was likely to be satisfactory.</p>

<p>She had certainly allowed Hetty to go away believing
that this was in her mind; and that was just what was
in her mind when her thoughts turned from Thomas,
whom she considered so estimable, to Rauzzini, whom she
loved. She loved the Roman singer so truly that she had
made a resolution never to consent to his marrying anyone
so insignificant as she believed herself to be.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>She had no illusions regarding herself. She knew just
how good-looking she was; she knew that by the side of
any of her sisters she was almost plain; but that she had
a pleasing, simple face of a very ordinary type. She
knew that she could love with the truest devotion and she
could trust herself not to change with time. But she
felt that these were not beyond the traits of the ordinary
young woman, and that they did not lift her from the
level of insignificance to the level of Signor Rauzzini.</p>

<p>She knew that she was at that moment an insignificant
person; and she made no attempt to think of herself as
otherwise.</p>

<p>Yes; but she had heard of people—even young women—being
insignificant one day, and the next springing
to a pinnacle of fame to which all eyes looked up. How
would it be if she were destined to reach in a moment a
position that would place her on a level with the man of
her thoughts—the man whose fame as a singer had
caused him to be the centre round which every conversation
in the most notable circles turned? Everyone was
talking in praise of Rauzzini; and she herself thought of
him as occupying a place on a height as far above her as
King Cophetua’s throne was above the marble steps at
the foot of which the beggar maid had crouched; but in
her mind there was the possibility that her name might
one day be spoken by the world in connection with an
achievement that would raise her from the insignificance
of Fanny Burney to the importance of Signor Rauzzini,
and prevent people from asking what on earth had induced
so glorious a person as he to make her his wife!</p>

<p>That was the secret dream which filled the imagination
of this imaginative young woman—the same dream
as comes to so many young women who have written the
last chapter of a book and sent it forth for the world to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
receive with acclaim—the dream of fame—of immortality!
She had written a novel and it was about to be
given to the world, if the world would have it, and upon
its success her happiness depended. If it brought her
fame, it would place her by the side of the man whom
she loved; but if it failed, then she would remain a person
of no significance, and quite unworthy of sharing the
honours which were showered upon her lover. She had
imagination, and this faculty it was that made her more
than doubtful of the success of King Cophetua’s rash
experiment. She felt sure that King Cophetua had now
and again, turning suddenly round, caught one of his
courtiers with his tongue in his cheek when his Majesty
was entering the throne-room with his shy and insignificant
Queen by his side, and that the Queen had occasionally
overheard the whispers of her maids of honour, when
they did not know she was at hand, asking one another
what on earth the King had seen in her that induced
him to make her his consort. Little Miss Burney had
long ago made up her mind that the union of King Cophetua
and his beggar maid was far from being a happy
one—that the King looked around him and saw several
princesses of great beauty and quite devoid of shyness
who were fully acquainted with the convenances of his
court and would not, if he had married any one of them,
have made the mistakes which she was sure the young
person whom he had elevated had fallen into, causing
him constant irritation.</p>

<p>Little Miss Burney had resolved that she would never
play the part of a crowned beggar maid. The man whom
she loved had won fame for himself, and she would not
go to him unless she, too, had at least made such a name
for herself as should prevent her from feeling herself in
the position of the beggar maid whom King Cophetua<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
had raised to his side. Little Miss Burney resolved that
although she could scarcely expect to go to her lover
wearing purple robes embroidered with gold, she could,
at any rate, refrain from wearing beggars’ rags. She
had her ambitions, and she felt that they were not ignoble,
but that they made for the happiness of the man
she loved, and who had been gracious enough to love her—the
least attractive member of the family.</p>

<p>But after she had sat for some time with her hands
lying idle on the sempstress’ work at which she had been
engaged on the departure of her sister—after her imagination
had carried her much farther away than she intended
it should, she was sensible of a return to the cold
world from which she had soared. Her heart, which
had begun to beat quickly when Hetty had told her how
the divine Rauzzini had spoken of her, sank within her
as she seemed to hear a voice asking who was she that she
should hope to reach by the publication of that story
which she had been writing by stealth and at odd times
during the past three years, even the smallest measure
of fame that would compare with that of Signor Rauzzini?
What fame attached to the writing of a novel in
comparison with that achieved by the enchantment of a
singer who had power to move the hearts of men and
women as it pleased him? Orpheus—ah, what fame
could compare with the fame of Orpheus, the singer?
His was a heaven-sent gift. What was her little talent
compared with such a gift? If she had the ability even
to make music such as one of her sisters could bring
forth from the keys of the piano, she would have a better
chance of being accounted worthy of a place beside
Signor Rauzzini than if her novel found its way to the
shelves of many readers. The writing of a novel was a
poor achievement—nay, in the opinion of a good many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
people, including her own stepmother—a most practical
woman—it was something to be ashamed of; and Fanny
herself, thinking over all the novels written by women
which she herself had read—most of them surreptitiously—was
disposed to agree with her. That was why
she had kept as a secret for more than three years the fact
that she was trying to write a novel. Her father knew
nothing of it, and her stepmother was equally uninformed.
Even her old friend Mr. Crisp, to whom she
wrote voluminous letters week after week, and to whom
she gave her confidence on many matters, had no suspicion
that she had written her novel.</p>

<p>She had thought it prudent to keep this matter hidden
from them, for she did not doubt that if she had told any
one of them of her project, she would never have a chance
of realizing it. They would certainly have pronounced
against such a proceeding even before a page of her novel
came to be written.</p>

<p>And yet it was the thought that this novel was shortly
to be published that had caused her to feel that she was
drawing nearer to her lover.</p>

<p>As she reflected upon this, sitting idly over her work
when her sister had left the house, her tears began to fall,
not in a torrent, but slowly dropping at intervals upon
the fabric which she had been sewing. She felt very sad,
very hopeless, very lonely.</p>

<p>Nor could it be said that the sudden return of Mrs.
Burney meant a return of happiness to the girl.</p>

<p>Mrs. Burney did not consider that Fanny had made
satisfactory progress with her work, and did not hesitate
to express her opinion to this effect. But she was not
imprudently unkind; for young Mr. Barlowe had just
written to her, begging permission to pay his respects
to Mrs. Burney and her daughter that evening, and she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
meant that Fanny should be in a good humour to entertain
him.</p>

<p>Mrs. Burney had great hopes that the question of
Fanny’s future—a constant topic of conversation and
consultation between her and her husband—might be
settled by a series of visits of young Mr. Barlowe.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p>Young Mr. Barlowe took himself very seriously, and
he had every right to do so; for a more serious
young man was not to be found in business in London.
He had been brought up to look upon everything in the
world as having an intimate connection with business,
and it had always been impressed upon him that business
meant the increase of money, and that there was
hardly anything in the world worth giving a thought to
apart from the increase of money. It never occurred to
any of his preceptors to suggest that the advantage of
increasing one’s money lay in the splendid possibilities
of spending it. The art of making money forms the
whole curriculum of a business man’s education; he is
supposed to require no instruction in the art of spending
it. Thus it is that, by attending only to one side of the
question so many business men lead much less interesting
lives than they might, if they had it in their power to
place themselves under the guidance of a trustworthy
professor of the Art of Spending. But no Chair of
Spending has yet been provided at any university, nor is
there any instructor on this important branch of business
education at any of the City schools, hence it is that
the sons of so many money-making men turn out spendthrifts.
They have been taught only one side of the
great money question, and that the less important side
into the bargain. In making an honest endeavour to
master the other side, usually on the death of a father
or a bachelor uncle, both looked on as close-fisted curmudgeons,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
a good many young men find themselves in
difficulties.</p>

<p>Young Mr. Barlowe, on being introduced to the Burney
family, through the circumstance of Mrs. Burney’s first
husband having done business with Mr. Barlowe the
elder, found himself in a strange atmosphere. He had
never before imagined the existence of a household where
music and plays and books were talked about as if these
were the profitable topics of life. Previously he had
lived in a house where the only profitable topic was
thought to be the Profits. At his father’s table in the
Poultry the conversation never travelled beyond the Profits.
The likelihood of a rise in the price of gold or silver
sometimes induced the father to increase his stock of
bullion without delay, and then if the price rose, he could
conscientiously charge his customers for the lace at such
a rate per ounce as gave him a clear five per cent. extra
profit; and it was upon such possibilities that the conversation
in the Poultry parlour invariably turned.</p>

<p>And here were these Burneys talking with extraordinary
eagerness and vivacity upon such matters as
the treatment by a singer named Gabrielli of one of the
phrases in a song of Mr. Handel’s, beginning: “Angels
ever bright and fair”! For himself, young Mr. Barlowe
thought that there was no need for so much repetition in
any song. “Angels ever bright and fair, Take, oh take
me to your care”—that was the whole thing, as it seemed
to him; and when that request had been made once he
thought it was quite enough; to repeat it half a dozen
times was irritating and really tended to defeat its purpose.
Only children in the nursery kept reiterating
their requests. But he had heard Dr. Burney and his
son-in-law, Esther’s husband, discuss the Gabrielli’s apparently
unauthorized pause before the second violins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
suggested (as it appeared to the younger musician) a
whisper of assent floating from the heaven; and all the
members of the family except Fanny had taken sides in
the controversy, as though a thing like that had any bearing
upon the daily life of the City!</p>

<p>Thomas Barlowe was amazed at the childishness of the
discussion, and he was particularly struck by the silence
of Fanny on this occasion. She was silent, he was sure,
because she agreed with him in thinking it ridiculous to
waste words over a point that should be relegated to the
nursery for settlement.</p>

<p>“They seem pleasant enough people in their way,” he
told his mother after his first visit. “But they know
nothing of what is going on in the world—the real world,
of which the Poultry is the centre. It might be expected
that the young man who is a naval officer and has seen
the world would know something of the import of the
question when I asked him what direction he thought
gold would move in; but he only winked and replied,
‘Not across my hawse, I dare swear,’ and the others
laughed as if he had said something humorous.”</p>

<p>“Mayhap it was humorous,” suggested his mother
gravely.</p>

<p>“It would be sheer ribaldry for anyone to jest upon
such a subject as the fluctuations in the price of silver,”
said Thomas slowly. “Lieutenant Burney must surely
know how serious a matter would be a fall of a fraction
of a crown when we have bought heavily in prospect of
a rise. But Miss Burney looks to be different from the
others of the family. I have told you that while her
father, and indeed all the rest, were talking excitedly on
that ridiculous point in Mr. Handel’s music, she sat in
silence. She is short-sighted, but I noticed more than
once that she had her eyes fixed on me, as if she had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
found something to study in me. She is, I think, a
steady, observant young lady. When Mrs. Burney said
she hoped that I would visit them again, I think I perceived
a sort of interest on Miss Burney’s face as she
awaited my answer.”</p>

<p>Thomas had resolved not to frustrate the hopes that
Mrs. Burney had expressed as to his paying another visit—as
a matter of fact he had come three times, and on
every occasion he had devoted himself to Fanny—to be
more exact than Mrs. Burney, who had described his
attentions in this phrase, he had passed his time subjecting
her to a sort of catechism with a view to discover if
she would make him the sort of wife that would suit him.
It appeared that the result of his inquisition was satisfactory,
and that his attentions were gradually becoming
intentions; but Mrs. Burney had never gone farther than
to comment favourably to Fanny upon the young man’s
steadiness, and to suggest that the young woman whom
he might choose to be his wife would be fortunate, steady
young men with good prospects in the City being far
from abundant. She had never gone so far as to ask
Fanny if she would accept good fortune coming to her
in such a form; though Fanny knew very well that she
had asked Esther to sound her on this point.</p>

<p>How far Esther’s mission was accounted successful by
their stepmother, Fanny, of course, could not guess; but
at any rate Thomas was to pay a visit after dinner, and
Fanny felt that it was necessary for her to be discreet.
It had been very interesting for her to study Thomas,
with the possibility before her of writing a second novel,
in which some of his traits of character might be introduced
with advantage; but she perceived how there was
a likelihood of her course of study being paid for at too
high a rate; so she resolved—to be discreet beyond her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
ordinary exercise of a virtue which she displayed at all
times of her life.</p>

<p>So Thomas came to the house in St. Martin’s Street
while tea was being served in the drawing-room, to the
accompaniment of a duet on the piano—Dr. Burney had
quickly perceived the merits of this new instrument over
that of the harpsichord—between Susan and her father.
Very close to the instrument, pressing the receiver of his
ear-trumpet to the woodwork of the case, sat Sir Joshua
Reynolds, while his sister—a lady of middle age who was
gradually relinquishing the idea that she, too, could paint
portraits—was suffering Mrs. Burney to explain to her
the advantages of Lynn over London as a place of residence
for people anxious to economize.</p>

<p>Fanny was at the table where the teapot and urn were
being drawn on, and close to her sat her brother James,
with a volume like an account-book lying face down on
the table while he drank his tea.</p>

<p>The progress of the duet was not arrested by the
entrance of young Mr. Barlowe, but he looked in the
direction of the instrument when he had shaken hands
with Mrs. Burney and bowed to Miss Reynolds. It was
obvious that he was mystified by seeing Sir Joshua’s ear-trumpet
pressed against the sound-conducting case of the
piano. He was still looking at it with curious eyes while
he greeted Fanny with the concentrated politeness of the
Poultry.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Burney roused himself from his lolling attitude
when he saw the puzzled look on the young man’s
face, and he obligingly endeavoured to explain away the
mystery.</p>

<p>“’Tis no wonder that you are amazed, Mr. Barlowe,”
he said in a whisper. “I own that when it was first
brought to my notice I thought it extraordinary. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
marvellous instrument, is it not, that is played by the
ear instead of by the mouth? And yet you must own
that some of the notes it produces are very fine—much
more delicate than could be produced by any other
means.”</p>

<p>“I do not profess to be a judge of music, sir,” said
Thomas; “but I know what pleases me.” Fanny wondered
how often she had heard that same boast—the attempt
of complete ignorance to be accredited with the
virtue of frankness. “Yes, I own that I consider the
music monstrous pretty; but with the ear—that is what
puzzles me: it seems a simple trumpet, such as is blown
by the mouth.”</p>

<p>“Pray do not let my father hear you say that, Mr. Barlowe,”
whispered James. “That instrument is his fondest.
You know that he has written a ‘History of
Music’?”</p>

<p>“All the world knows that, sir,” replied Thomas gallantly.
“I have not yet found time to read it myself,
but—”</p>

<p>“Neither have I, sir; but I understand that that instrument
which seems new to such simpletons as you and
I is really as ancient as the pyramids of Egypt—nay,
more so, for my father discovered in his researches that
this was the identical form of the first instrument made
by Tubal Cain himself.”</p>

<p>“Is’t possible? In our Family Bible there is a picture
of Tubal Cain, but he is depicted blowing through
a conch shell.”</p>

<p>“A shell! Ah! such was the ignorance of the world
on these matters before my father wrote his History.
But he has managed to clear up many points upon which
complete ignorance or very erroneous opinions prevailed.
It is not generally known, for instance, that Tubal had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
his second name given to him by reason of his habitually
murdering every musical piece that he attempted to
play.”</p>

<p>“But he was the inventor, was he not?”</p>

<p>“Quite true, Mr. Barlowe. But that fact, you must
admit, only made his offence the more flagrant. So the
inscriptions on the rocks assert; and there are some sensible
people nowadays who believe that Tubal’s second and
very suggestive name should be coupled with the names
of many more recent performers on musical instruments.”</p>

<p>“You do not allude to the gentleman who is playing
that new instrument—I mean that very ancient instrument—by
the side of Dr. Burney?”</p>

<p>“Oh, surely not. That gentleman is one of the most
notable performers of our age, Mr. Barlowe. I ask you
plainly, sir, have you ever seen, even at a raree show, a
musician who could play an instrument with his ear and
produce such a good effect? You can easily believe that
a vast amount of ingenuity is needed to produce even
the simplest sound in that way.”</p>

<p>“If I had not it demonstrated before my eyes I should
not believe it possible. I protest, sir, that the effect is
very pretty. Is’t not so, Miss Burney?”</p>

<p>The young man turned to Fanny, who was doing her
best to refrain from an outburst of laughter; she could
not trust herself to put her cup of tea to her lips while
her brother was continuing his fooling. She thought
that it was scarcely good manners of him to play such a
jest upon a visitor, though she knew the ward-room code
of manners which her naval brother had acquired was
very liberal on such points. She was about to give Mr.
Barlowe a hint of the truth of Sir Joshua’s ear-trumpet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
but James, perceiving her intention, defeated it by saying
in a tone above a whisper:</p>

<p>“Cain—we mentioned Cain, did we not, Mr. Barlowe?
Oh, yes; and it must have occurred to you how strangely
customs have altered during the past ten years—how
strongly opposed people are to-day to principles that
were accepted without demur so recently as in our own
boyhood. You take my meaning, sir?”</p>

<p>Mr. Barlowe did not look as if he quite grasped Lieutenant
Burney’s drift, and Fanny felt it incumbent on
her to prevent further fooling (as he thought she would)
by remarking:</p>

<p>“My brother means, Mr. Barlowe, that ’tis remarkable
how many changes are being made in many ways—but
what he had in his mind was, of course, in respect to the
forte-piano—on which my father and sister are playing
a duet: only a few years ago no one thought to improve
upon the harpsichord; and yet my father asserts that in
a short time the harpsichord will be no more than a
curiosity—that the forte-piano—or as we simply call it
now, the piano, will take its place in every household.
That is what you meant, was it not, James?”</p>

<p>“I was thinking of Cain and his profession—Cain, the
good old murderer, rather than of Tubal Cain, who was
perhaps equally criminal in inventing the liveliest source
of human torture,” replied James gravely. “Yes, I
was thinking—suggested by the mention of Cain—how
strange people nowadays would regard my father’s intentions
regarding my future when he assumed that I
should have the best chance for cultivating my bent,
which he had early recognized in me, by sending me,
before it became too late, to be educated for the profession
to an accomplished murderer.”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<p>Young Mr. Barlowe started so violently that he spilt
his tea over his knees; for just before James had
uttered his last sentence the music stopped, but as it
had been somewhat loud in the final bars, and James
raised his voice in the same proportion, the inertia of his
tone defied any attempt to modulate it, so that it was
almost with a shout that he had declared that he had been
sent to be educated in his profession to a murderer.</p>

<p>Fanny was too much overcome by the ludicrous aspect
of the contretemps to be able to laugh. Her brother,
who had had no intention of startling anyone in the
room except young Mr. Barlowe, hung his head and was
blushing under the South Sea tan of his skin; Sir Joshua
Reynolds had heard nothing after the crashing chords
that concluded the duet; but poor Miss Reynolds almost
sprang from her chair in horror.</p>

<p>Mrs. Burney was very angry.</p>

<p>“You have been making a fool of yourself as usual,
James,” she cried. “Pray give Mr. Barlowe another
cup of tea, Fanny. I vow that ’tis a shame for you,
James Burney, to treat such a company as though you
were on the deck of the <i>Adventure</i> facing your South
Sea savages.”</p>

<p>But Dr. Burney, with his customary tact, raised a
hand half reprovingly toward his wife.</p>

<p>“Give Mr. Barlowe his cup, and then pass one to me,
Fanny,” he said, rising from the piano. “You know that
James has spoken no more than the truth, my dear,” he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
added, smiling at his wife. “I can see that the rascal
has been fooling while our backs were turned to him;
but we know that he spoke no more than the truth—at
least in that one sentence which he bawled out for us.
He was, indeed, sent to a school where he was placed
under an accomplished usher who was some time after
hanged as a murderer. You see, madam—” he had
turned, still smiling, to Miss Reynolds, thereby doing
much to restore her confidence in the sanity of the
family—“You see that James was from the first so desperate
a young rascal that, just as a boy who is an adept
at figures is educated for the counting-house, and one
who spends all the day before he is six picking out tunes
on the harpsichord should be apprenticed, as I was, to a
musician, so we thought our James should be sent
whither he could be properly grounded in the only profession
at which he was likely to excel. But, alas! the
poor usher was carried off by the police, tried at the next
assizes and duly hanged before James had made much
progress in his studies; but I believe that a few years in
the navy does as much for a youth who has made up his
mind to succeed, as a protracted course under a fully
qualified criminal.”</p>

<p>Miss Reynolds looked as if she were not quite certain
that, in spite of his smiles, Dr. Burney was jesting; but
when Mrs. Burney, seeing how her husband’s mock seriousness
was likely to produce a wrong impression upon
plain people, said:</p>

<p>“You must recall hearing about Mr. Eugene Aram
some years back, Mrs. Reynolds,” that lady showed that
her mind was greatly relieved.</p>

<p>“I recall the matter without difficulty,” she said.
“The man was usher at the grammar school at Lynn.”</p>

<p>“And no school had a more learned teacher than that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
unfortunate man,” said Sir Joshua. Young Barlowe
had been divided in his amazement at what Dr. Burney
had said, and at the sight of Sir Joshua holding the
trumpet to his ear, though the instrument remained mute.
He had never found himself within the circle of so
startling a society. He wished himself safe at home in
the Poultry, where people talked sense and made no
attempt to blow a trumpet with their ears.</p>

<p>“James had acquired quite a liking for poor Aram,”
said Dr. Burney, “and, indeed, I own to having had a
high opinion of the man’s ability myself. It was to
enable him to purchase books necessary for his studies
in philology that he killed his victim—a contemptible
curmudgeon named Johnstone. I fear that all our
sympathy was on the side of the usher.”</p>

<p>“I was greatly interested in Mr. Aram, and read a full
account of his trial,” said Sir Joshua. “I wonder that
a man of so sensitive a mind as his did not so brood over
his crime as to cause suspicion to fall on him earlier than
it did.”</p>

<p>“Only upon one occasion it seemed that he was affected
by an incident which might possibly have awakened
some suspicion in the mind of a person given to
suspicion,” said Dr. Burney. “James had been presented
with a copy of the translation of Gessner’s ‘Death
of Abel’—everyone was going mad about the book that
year—more copies were sold of it than of any translation
since Pope’s ‘Homer,’ but I fancy James found it
dull enough reading. He had it on his knee trying to
get through a page or two in case the kind donor might
question him upon it, when the usher came up. He took
the volume in his hand and glanced at the title. Down
the book fell from his grasp and he hurried away without
a word—‘as if he had been stung,’ James said, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
telling us about it, to excuse the broken cover. Of
course, I never gave a thought to the matter at the time;
but when I heard of the arrest of Eugene Aram the following
year, I recalled the incident.”</p>

<p>“I should like to make a picture of the scene, and
name it ‘Remorse,’” said Reynolds.</p>

<p>(He never did make such a picture; many years had
passed, and Lieutenant Burney had become an Admiral
before his narration of the incident touched the
imagination of a poet who dealt with it in verse that has
thrilled a good many readers.)</p>

<p>Thomas Barlowe was not greatly thrilled by the story
as told by Dr. Burney. He seemed rather shocked to
find himself at the table with someone who had been
taught by a murderer. He glanced furtively at James
Burney, who had remained silent since the contretemps
that had prevented him from perfecting his fooling of
Thomas; and the result of Thomas’s scrutiny at that
moment was to cause Thomas a tremor; for who could
say what fearful knowledge Lieutenant Burney might
have acquired during his intercourse with the murderer—knowledge
which might jeopardize the safety of a
simple visitor like himself? Thomas felt that no ordinary
person could be accounted absolutely safe in a company
that included a tall, able-bodied young naval man
who had begun his education under a murderer and had
gone to complete it among the cannibals of the South
Seas; and, in addition, an elderly gentleman who fancied
that he could bring any sound out of a trumpet by pressing
it to his ear instead of his lips, and had shown himself
ready to extol the scholarship of any man who had
been hanged.</p>

<p>But then Thomas looked at Fanny, and she pleased
him more than ever. She was so demure, so modest, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
shy. She had a very pretty blush, and she did not play
on the piano. It was a thousand pities, he felt, that such
a girl should be compelled to remain in such uncongenial
companionship. All the time that Dr. Burney and his
other daughter were playing a second duet, and the silly
gentleman holding the bell of his trumpet to the case of
the piano, still fondly believing that he was also a performer
with the mouth-piece in his ear, Thomas Barlowe
was feeling wave after wave of pity passing over him for
the unhappy position of the shy girl in the midst of so
doubtful a household. Before long his compassion for
her so stimulated his imagination that he began to think
of the possibility of his rescuing her—he began to think
of himself in the character of a hero—he did not remember
the name of any particular hero who had
carried off a young woman who was placed in a similar
situation to that occupied by Miss Burney; but he
had no doubt that more than one romance was founded
upon the doings of such a man as he felt himself fully
qualified to be, if he made up his mind to assume such a
rôle.</p>

<p>As the music continued—it was an arrangement of
Gluck’s <cite>Orfèo</cite>—Thomas Barlowe became more and more
resolute. He would be the heroic person who should
appear at the right moment and achieve the emancipation
of that sweet and shy girl, who by no fault of hers
was forced to live in that house and remain, if she could,
on friendly terms with her father and sisters, who kept
strumming on the piano, and with her brother, who was
ready to boast of having received the rudiments of his
education from a murderer. All that he needed was the
opportunity to show his heroism, and he did not doubt
that when he set his mind to work on the matter, he
would have such an opportunity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>If anyone had whispered in his ear that his inward
consciousness of being equal to the doing of great deeds
was solely due to the music which was being played,
and to which he was unwillingly listening, he would
have been indignant. He would have thought it preposterous
had it been suggested to him that the effect of
that strumming was to make him feel more like a god
than a man—to be ready to face hell for the love of a
woman, as Jean Sebastian Bach imagined Orpheus doing
for Eurydice. But Christoph Gluck knew what
he was about when he had composed his <cite>Orfèo</cite>, and Dr.
Burney was quite equal to the business of interpreting
his aims, and of urging his daughter Susan to join with
him in impressing them upon even so unimpressionable
a nature as that of Thomas Barlowe; so that while
Thomas Barlowe believed that this music was one of the
most petty of all human interests, it was making him
think such thoughts as had never before entered his
mind—it was giving him aspirations from which in
ordinary circumstances he would have shrunk.</p>

<p>The master musician and his interpreters were making
sport of him, leading him if not quite into the
region of the heroic, at least to the boundary of that
region, and supplying him with a perspective glass, as
the Interpreter did to the Pilgrims, by the aid of which
he might see the wonderful things that had been beyond
his natural scope.</p>

<p>And that was how it came about that he gazed into
Miss Burney’s eyes and pressed her hand at parting
with a tenderness he had never previously associated
with his leave-taking. He felt sure that Miss Burney
would understand what he meant, though he knew that
he would have difficulty in expressing it all to her in
words; for the effect of the music was to make him feel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
that he could put so much feeling into a look, into a
squeeze of the hand, as would touch the heart of any
young woman and cause her to be certain that she
might trust him though all other help might fail her.</p>

<p>That was the effect which the heroic music had upon
him, though he did not know it; it made him feel willing
to face hell for her sake at that moment, and even until
he had walked through more than a mile of the network
of streets that lay between Leicester Fields and the
Poultry.</p>

<p>But the effect of such an intoxicant as music upon
such a nature as his is not lasting. Before he had
reached Cheapside his own individuality was beginning
to assert itself; and he wondered if he had not gone too
far for discretion—discretion being, according to his
reckoning, the power to withdraw from a position that
might compromise him. And before he reached his
home he had got the length of wondering how he had
so far forgotten himself as to yield to that compromising
impulse represented by the gaze and the squeeze. He
could not for the life of him understand what had come
over him at that moment; for he had by no means
satisfied himself that Miss Burney was the young
woman who would make him comfortable as his wife.
He still thought highly of her on account of her modesty
and her dainty shyness, but marriage was a serious
matter, and he was not sure that he should take her for
his wife.</p>

<p>On the whole, he felt that he had had a very trying
evening—between the Lieutenant who had so nearly
qualified to practise as a murderer, and the father and
daughter who seemed ready to strum their duets until
midnight, to say nothing of the foolish gentleman who
tried to play the trumpet with his ear; and Thomas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
made up his mind that he would not trust himself into
the midst of so unusual a circle until he was certain that
he wanted to marry the young woman whose hand he
had, for some reason or other, pressed at parting.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Burney had noticed much more clearly than
Fanny had done the expression that the face of Thomas
Barlowe had worn when he had looked into the girl’s
eyes; she had measured to the fraction of a second the
duration of his holding of her hand beyond the time
essential for the discharge of the ordinary courtesy of a
hand-shake; and she was satisfied that Thomas was progressing
in his wooing of the least attractive and certainly
the least accomplished member of the family.
The good woman thought, however, that it was rather a
pity that her husband and Susan had persisted in the
practice of their duets; for by doing so they had not
given a chance to Thomas and Fanny of being alone
together.</p>

<p>But, looking back upon the incidents of the evening,
she came to the conclusion that, on the whole, she had
no reason to complain of the progress that was being
made in the young man’s wooing. She was no believer
in undue haste in this respect; and had not Thomas
looked into Fanny’s eyes at the close of the evening?
Yes, at the close; and that proved to her satisfaction
that he had not suffered discouragement by the maladroit
conversation about Mr. Eugene Aram. The unhappy
episode upon which her husband had dwelt with
far too great attention to its details, was one to which
she herself had never alluded; for at Lynn, where she
had lived all her life previous to being married to Dr.
Burney, the Eugene Aram episode was regarded as a
scandal to be ignored by those of the inhabitants whose
children had attended the school where he had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
usher. It was a distinctly favourable sign of the impression
made upon young Mr. Barlowe by Fanny, that
he had gazed into her eyes in spite of his having been
made aware of the connection of the family with the
tragedy of that wretched schoolmaster. Mrs. Burney
took no account of the effect of Bach’s marvellous music
upon a young man who was a lover in the rough. In
this respect, as has been indicated, she did not differ
from the young man himself.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p>It was at the Pantheon in the Oxford Road a fortnight
later, that Mrs. Thrale, the brewer’s lively
wife, had an opportunity of shining, by a display of
that <i lang="fr">esprit</i> which caused Mr. Garrick to affirm solemnly
that if she had gone upon the stage she would have been
a dangerous rival to Mistress Clive; and Fanny Burney,
with her father and Mr. Linley, the father of the beautiful
Mrs. Sheridan, was a witness of the ease with which
the lady sparkled as she described for the benefit of the
circle how Mr. Garrick’s jest at the expense of poor
Mr. Kendal and the Widow Nash had set all the Wells
laughing. She imitated Mr. Garrick to his face, in offering
his congratulations to Mr. Kendal and so setting
the ball a-rolling until within an hour the poor, silly
gentleman had been offered the felicitations of half the
Wells upon his engagement to Widow Nash. Mrs.
Thrale re-enacted with great gravity the part she had
played in Mr. Garrick’s plot, and then she hastened to
imitate Mrs. Cholmondeley’s part, and even Mr. Sheridan’s,
upon that lively morning at Tunbridge Wells.</p>

<p>But there was much more to tell, and Mrs. Thrale
took very good care to abate nothing of her narrative;
it gave her so good a chance of acting, and it gave Mr.
Garrick so good a chance of complimenting her before
all the company.</p>

<p>“Oh, I vow that we played our parts to perfection,”
she cried, “and without any rehearsal either. But
then what happened? You will scarce believe it, Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
Garrick has always borne such a character for scrupulous
honour in his dealings with his companies, but
indeed ’tis a fact that our manager decamped as soon
as he found that the poor man had been teased to the
verge of madness by the fooling he had started—off he
went, we knew not whither; leaving no message for any
of us. He was not to be found by noon; and what
happened by dinner-time? Why, the poor gentleman
whom we had been fooling had also fled!”</p>

<p>“That was indeed too bad of Mr. Kendal,” said Dr.
Burney.</p>

<p>“’Twas too inconsiderate of him truly,” cried Mrs.
Thrale. “’Tis no great matter if the manager of the
playhouse runs away when his play is produced—you
remember that Mr. Colman hurried off to Bath to
escape lampooners when the success of Dr. Goldsmith’s
comedy <cite>She Stoops to Conquer</cite> had proved to all the
town that he was no judge of a play; but for the one
who has been made the object of such a jest as ours to
escape without giving us a chance of bringing our
teasing to a fitting climax is surely little short of infamous.”</p>

<p>“And when did you design the fitting climax to
arrive, madam?” asked one of the circle.</p>

<p>“Why, when the gentleman and lady should come
face to face in the Assembly Rooms, to be sure,” replied
Mrs. Thrale. “We were all there to await the scene of
their meeting; and you can judge of our chagrin when
only the lady appeared.”</p>

<p>“We can do so, indeed,” said Mrs. Damer, who was
also in the circle. “I can well believe that you were
furious. When one has arranged a burletta for two
characters ’tis infamous when only one of the actors
appears on the stage.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Thrale smiled the smile of the lady who knows
that she is harbouring a surprise for her friends and
only awaits the right moment to spring it upon them—a
cat to be let out of the bag at the pulling of a string.</p>

<p>“I knew that we should have your sympathy, Mrs.
Damer,” she said demurely. “You have, I doubt not,
more than once experienced all the chagrin that follows
the miscarrying of a well-planned scheme. But as it so
happened, we were more than compensated for our ill-usage
at that time by the unlooked-for appearance of
the missing actor two nights later.”</p>

<p>“Oh, lud!” cried Mrs. Damer, holding up both her
hands in a very dainty way.</p>

<p>Mr. Garrick also lifted up his hands in amazement,
but he did not need to exclaim anything to emphasize
the effect of his gesture.</p>

<p>Dr. Burney smiled, trying to catch the eye of Mr.
Garrick, but Mr. Garrick took very good care that he
should not succeed in doing so.</p>

<p>“You may well cry, ‘oh, lud!’” said Mrs. Thrale.
“But if you had been in the Rooms when the man
entered you would not have been able to say a word for
surprise, I promise you. The poor gentleman had
posted all the way from town to Tunbridge, apparently
for our diversion only, and what a sight he was! It
seems that he had got over his fright at the coupling of
his name with the lady’s, while flying to London, but
from this point a reaction set in, and he spent all the
time that he was posting back to the Wells adding fuel
to the fire of his resolution to throw himself at the feet
of the lady at the earliest possible moment. Was there
ever such a comedy played, Mr. Garrick?”</p>

<p>“’Twould be too extravagant for the theatre, madam,
but not for Nature’s playhouse,” replied Garrick. “I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
have more than once been told the story of soldiers
having fled in a panic from the field of battle, but on
finding themselves in a place of safety they returned to
the fight and fought like demons. Was there aught that
could be termed demoniacal in the gentleman’s conduct
on finding himself face to face with the enemy—I mean
the lady?”</p>

<p>“Aught demoniacal, do you ask me?” cried Mrs.
Thrale. “Oh, sir, have you not heard the parable of
the demon that was cast out of a man, but finding its
homeless condition unsupportable, sought out seven of
its friends and returned with them to its former habitation,
so that the last state of the man was more demoniacal
than the first?”</p>

<p>“I fancy I have heard the parable, madam, but its
application—” began Garrick, when Mrs. Darner broke
in upon him, crying:</p>

<p>“Do not ever attempt to point out the aptness of the
application of a parable, Mrs. Thrale. Do not, if you
are wise. Would you lead us to believe that the unhappy
wretch found it necessary to post up to town to
obtain his relay of demons for his own discomfiture
when so much rank and fashion was at the Wells,
though at the fag end of the season?”</p>

<p>“Leaving parables aside, demons and all, I can bear
witness to the condition of the man when he entered
the Rooms and strode with determination on his face up
to where the Widow Nash was fanning herself—not
without need,” said Mrs. Thrale. “It so happened that
she was seated under the gallery at the furthest end of
the Rooms, but our gentleman did not pause on entering
to look round for her—I tell you that it seemed as if
he went by instinct straight up to her, and bowing
before her, said: ‘Madam, may I beg the honour of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
word or two with you in private?’—I was close by and
so were several other equally credible witnesses, and we
heard every word. The widow looked at him coolly—”</p>

<p>“Yes, you said she had been fanning herself,” remarked
Mrs. Damer, but without interrupting the flow
of the narrative.</p>

<p>“There was no need of a fan for her voice, I can
assure you, when she had completed her survey of the
dusty gentleman and thought fit to reply to him,” continued
Mrs. Thrale. “‘I vow, sir,’ said she, ‘that I
consider this room sufficiently private for anything you
have to say to me.’ She had plainly got wind of Mr.
Garrick’s plot and so was fully prepared for the worst—though
some people might call it the best—that could
happen. ‘Madam,’ said Mr. Kendal, ‘what I have to
say is meant for your ear alone,’ and I am bound to
admit that he spoke with suavity and dignity. ‘Pray
let my friends here be the judges of that,’ said the
widow. That was a pretty rebuff for any gentleman
with a sense of his own dignity, you will say; but he
did not seem to accept it in such a spirit. He hesitated,
but only for a few moments, then he looked around him
to see who were within hearing, and with hardly a pause,
he said in the clearest of tones, ‘I perceive that we are
surrounded just now with some ladies who, two days
ago, offered me congratulations upon my good fortune
in winning your promise, madam; and I venture now
to come before you to implore of you to give me permission
to assume that their congratulations were well
founded’—those were his words; we did not think that
he had it in him to express himself so well.”</p>

<p>“And what was the lady’s reply?” asked Dr. Burney,
recalling the prophecy in which he had indulged when
parting from Garrick at his own door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>“The lady’s reply was disappointing, though dignified,”
replied Mrs. Thrale. “‘Sir,’ she said, ‘I have
oft heard that the credulity of a man has no limits, but
I have never before had so conspicuous an instance of
the truth of this. Surely the merest schoolboy would
have been able to inform you that you were being made
the victim of one of Mr. Garrick’s silly jests—that these
ladies here lent themselves to the transaction, hoping to
make a fool of me as well as of you; but I trust that
they are now aware of the fact that I, at least, perceived
the truth from the first, so that whoever has been fooled
I am not that person; and so I have the honour to wish
you and them a very good evening.’ Then she treated
us to a very elaborate curtsey and stalked away to the
door, leaving us all amazed at her display of dignity—real
dignity, not the stage imitation, Mr. Garrick.”</p>

<p>“You should have been there, if only to receive a
lesson, Mr. Garrick,” said Mrs. Damer.</p>

<p>“I hope those who had the good fortune to be present
were taught a lesson,” said another lady in the circle.</p>

<p>“If you mean me, madam,” said Mrs. Thrale, with
tactful good humour, “I frankly allow that I profited
greatly by observing the scene. ’Tis a dangerous game
to play—that of trying to show others in a ridiculous
light, and in future I vow that all my attention shall be
given to the duty of avoiding making a fool of myself.
Your jest miscarried, Mr. Garrick; though how that
gentleman who fled from the Wells in that headlong
fashion was induced to return, is beyond my knowledge.”</p>

<p>“Psha! madam, the fellow is a coxcomb and not worth
discussing,” cried Garrick. “He got no more than his
deserts when the lady left him to be the laughing-stock
of the Assembly. I knew that that would be his fate if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
he ever succeeded in summing up sufficient courage to
face her.”</p>

<p>“But strange to say, we did not laugh at him then,”
said Mrs. Thrale. “He seemed to be quite a different
man from the one whom we had tried to fool two days
earlier. There was a certain dignity about him that
disarmed us. You must allow, Mr. Garrick, that only
the bravest of men would have had the courage to march
up the Assembly Rooms and make his proposal to the
lady in public.”</p>

<p>“That is the courage of the coxcomb who believes
himself to be irresistible to the other sex, madam,” said
Garrick; “and I affirm that ’twas most reprehensible to
refrain from laughing at him.” Then, putting his arm
through that of Burney as if to stroll on with him, and
so give the others to understand that he had had enough
of Mr. Kendal as a topic, he whispered:</p>

<p>“Ha, my friend, did not I prophesy aright what
would be the fellow’s fate? I know men, and women,
too—ay, in some measure, though they are sealed books,
eh, friend Burney? And you tried to persuade me that
she would not snub him? I knew better—I knew that
she—eh, what—what are they staring at?”</p>

<p>“They are staring at the appearance of Mr. Kendal
with the Widow Nash on his arm—there they are, David,
and you are staring at them too,” said Burney with a
smile.</p>

<p>“Angels and Ministers of Grace! ’Tis a man and
his wife we are staring at! The woman has married
him after all!” cried David, his hand dropping limply
from Burney’s shoulder. “A man and his wife: I
know the look in their faces!”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p>It was, indeed, the same man who had come to consult
Dr. Burney, but had not been allowed the chance
of doing so by Garrick, a fortnight before—the same
man, but with a marked difference, who was now walking
across the pillared room in the Pantheon, with a
smiling, well-favoured lady by his side; and toward the
pair the eyes of all the circle whom Mrs. Thrale had
been addressing were directed.</p>

<p>Mrs. Thrale and her friends were too much amazed to
be able to speak, but the lips of every one of them were
holding back some exclamation of surprise: an acute
observer would have been able easily to set down the
various unuttered exclamations of the party, from the
simple “Oh, Lud!” of Mrs. Thrale to the more emphatic
“Merciful Powers!” of Mrs. Cholmondeley,
though not a word was spoken between them, while Mr.
Kendal and the lady walked straight through the room
to where they were standing.</p>

<p>“Slip behind the pillar: I will cover you, my friend,”
whispered Dr. Burney to Garrick.</p>

<p>But Garrick had no intention of doing anything so
ignominious—more especially as he perceived that Mr.
Kendal had caught sight of him; and it was really Garrick
who advanced to meet the couple, with the air of a
host about to welcome two long-expected guests—it was
really Garrick who received them with one of his
finest bows, and who—to add to the amazement of the
group behind him—was greeted by Mr. Kendal and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
lady with the friendliest of smiles (the lady was blushing,
not Mr. Garrick).</p>

<p>And then it was to Dr. Burney the gentleman turned.</p>

<p>“Dear sir,” he cried, “with what words should I
approach you? It is to your counsel and Mr. Garrick’s
that I owe my happiness.” Then he made his bow to
the others of the group.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Thrale,” he said, when he had recovered himself,
“we hoped to find you here with your friends, so
that we might lose no moment in offering you our
thanks for the tactful way in which you brought us
together. Only such genius as yours, madam, could
have perceived—well, all that you did perceive. I protest
that neither Mrs. Kendal nor myself apprehended
the too flattering truth. But the heart of a woman who
has herself loved—ah, that is the source of such genius
as you displayed with such subtlety. She is mine,
madam; we have been married a whole week, and I, at
least, know what a treasure—but I cannot trust myself
to talk of my happiness just now. Perhaps at some
future time I shall be able to tell you coherently how I
felt within me that my Diana—Mrs. Nash, as she was
then—did not mean her rebuff as a final dismissal, and
thus I was led to her side—to implore an audience of
her, in the course of which she confessed to me that—”</p>

<p>But his bride prevented the flow of his eloquence by
tapping him under the chin in exquisite playfulness
with her fan, smiling roguishly at him first, and then
looking round the group with an air of chastened
triumph while she said:</p>

<p>“Foolish man! Prithee remember, Ferdinand, that
you are in a public place, and that the secrets of the
confessional are sacred. I protest that you are exceeding
a husband’s privilege in revealing aught that I confessed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
when taken aback at your sudden appearance
before me!”</p>

<p>“I ask your pardon, my angel,” he cried. “I had
no right to say even the little that I have said. I suppose
I shall learn discretion in time and with practice.
But when I think of the kindly interest that some of
our friends here showed in bringing us together, I feel
that they should be rewarded by a repetition of the
whole story.”</p>

<p>“Nay, nay, sir, you may take my word for it that we
look not for such a reward,” cried Garrick. “Such
philanthropists as Mrs. Thrale and myself feel more
than rewarded when we succeed in bringing together
a lady and gentleman who were so plainly intended by
Providence for each other’s happiness.”</p>

<p>“It was Mr. Garrick who looked with the eyes of
Providence into your case as associated with Mr. Kendal,
madam. That is, if Puck may ever be thought of as
assuming the rôle of Providence,” said Mrs. Thrale.
“For myself, I believe that Puck has more to do with
the making of matches than heaven; and assuredly in
this particular case the mischievous fairy had more than
a finger. But however that may be, we can still wish
you every happiness in life, and offer you an apology
for—”</p>

<p>“H’sh!” whispered Garrick, raising a hand. “Rauzzini
is beginning to sing. I am sure, Mrs. Kendal, that
you will willingly accept Signor Rauzzini’s song in lieu
of Mrs. Thrale’s apology, however admirably worded the
latter were sure to be.”</p>

<p>The bride smiled benignly at Mrs. Thrale, and there
was more than a trace of triumph in her smile.</p>

<p>Dr. Burney smiled also at the adroitness of the actor,
who, he could perceive, had no intention of allowing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
himself to be incriminated by any confession, assuming
the form of an apology, that Mrs. Thrale might make in
a moment of contrition for having been a partner with
him in a piece of fooling that had had a very different
result from the one he (and she) had looked for.</p>

<p>Garrick, still holding up a warning finger as if he had
at heart the best interests of the composer as well as the
singer of “Waft her, Angels,” prevented another word
from being spoken, though more than a full minute had
passed before Rauzzini had breathed the first notes of
the recitativo.</p>

<p>But incautiously lowering his finger when the handsome
Roman had begun, Mrs. Thrale took advantage of
her release from the thraldom imposed upon her, to say
in a low tone, looking toward the gallery in front of
which the singer stood:</p>

<p>“It is one angel talking to the others! Was there
ever so angelic a man?”</p>

<p>And little Miss Burney, who had also her eyes fixed
upon the singer, felt that little Mrs. Thrale was not
merely an angel, but a goddess. She expressed her
opinion to this effect in her next letter to Mr. Crisp.</p>

<p>She listened in a dream to the singing that no one
could hear and remain unmoved, even though one had
not the advantage of looking at the singer at the same
time. Fanny Burney was too short-sighted to be able to
distinguish one face from another at such a distance;
but this made no difference to her; she had the face of
the sweet singer ever before her—most clearly when she
closed her eyes, as she did now, and listened to him.</p>

<p>“Waft her, angels, to the skies—Waft her, angels,
waft her, angels, waft her to the skies,” rang out his
fervent imploration, and she felt that there were no
powers that could withstand the force of such an appeal.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
For herself she felt carried away on the wings of song
into the highest heaven. She felt that harps of heaven
alone could provide an adequate accompaniment to such
a voice as his; and she gave herself up to it as unreservedly
as a bride gives herself to the arms of her
lover. She had that sensation of a sweet yielding to
the divine influence of the music until she could feel it
enfolding her and bearing her into the infinite azure of
a realm more beautiful than any that her dreams had
borne her to in the past. She wanted nothing better
than this in any world. All that she wanted was an
assurance that it would continue for ever and ever....</p>

<p>With the cessation of the singing she seemed to awaken
from a dream of divine delight and in her awaking to
retain the last thought that had been hers—the longing
for an assurance that the delight which she was feeling
would endure. She was awake now, and she knew that
love had been all her dream, and that what she longed
for was the assurance that that love would continue.
And now she remembered that it was this same longing
that had brought about her resolution that she would
never go to her King as the beggar maid had gone to
King Cophetua. There would be no assurance of the
continuing of love between them if she had the humiliating
feeling that he had stooped to raise her to his level.</p>

<p>That was the thought which took possession of her
mind when she had returned from the sublimities to
which she had been borne by her lover’s singing, and in
another minute the reaction had come. She had been
soaring high, but now she was conscious of a sinking
at heart; for the whole building was resounding with acclamations
of the singer. There did not seem to be
anyone silent, save only herself, throughout the hall.
Everyone seemed calling the name of Rauzzini—all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
seemed ready to throw themselves at his feet; and when
he stood up to acknowledge their tribute of enthusiasm
to his marvellous powers, there was something of frenzy
in the way his name was flung from hundreds of voices—it
was not enough for the people whom he had stirred
to shout his name, they surrounded him with the banners
of a great conqueror—the air was quivering with
the lace and the silk that were being waved on all sides
to do him honour—handkerchiefs, scarves, fans—the air
was full of them.</p>

<p>And there he stood high above them, smiling calmly
and bending his head gravely to right and left in
acknowledgment of all....</p>

<p>That was his position before the world. Her heart
sank within her as she asked herself what was hers.
How could she ever hope to attain to such a place as
should win from the world such applause as this? How
could she ever be so vain as to think that the giving of a
little book to the world should have an effect worthy of
being compared with this demonstration which was
shaking the Pantheon?</p>

<p>Her heart sank to a deeper depth still when the
thunders had passed away—reluctantly as the reverberations
of a great storm—and there was a buzz of voices
all about her—exclamations of delight—whispers of admiration—ladies
with clasped hands, fervent in their
words about the marvellous face of the young Roman—and
her father and his friend, Mr. Fulke Greville, exchanging
recollections of the singing of the same air by
other vocalists, and coming gradually to the conclusion
that none had put such feeling into it as had Rauzzini.</p>

<p>The buzz of voices did not cease when the singer had
come down from his gallery and was greeting some of
his friends on the floor of the great hall. He had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
trouble in making his way as far as the group which he
meant to reach. The most distinguished ladies of high
quality had pressed round him with uncritical expressions
of appreciation of his singing, and there was no
lack of gentlemen of fashion to follow their example,
though wondering greatly that the ladies of quality
should allow themselves to show such transports respecting
a man with no trait of a true-born Englishman
about him. Signor Rauzzini might have indulged in a
score of pinches of snuff out of the gold and enamelled
boxes that were thrust forward for his acceptance with
the finest artificial grace of a period when it was not
thought effeminate to be graceful over small things.</p>

<p>He bowed low to the ladies of quality, and smiled his
polite rejection of the snuff of the gentlemen of fashion.
But such convenances made it impossible for him to
keep his eyes upon the group toward which he was
making a necessarily slow way, and he only reached the
side of Dr. Burney to find that Dr. Burney’s daughter
had disappeared. He had no chance of seeing how Miss
Burney at his approach had slipped behind a pillar and
suffered herself to be conducted thence to a seat by her
cousin Edward: the fact that Edward was learning to be
a painter was a sufficient excuse for his paying an occasional
visit to such scenes of colour as were unfolded
before the eyes of a frequenter of the fashionable Pantheon
every night.</p>

<p>Fanny felt that if Signor Rauzzini had come to her
side after passing through the ranks of lace and velvet
and brocade, she would have sunk through the floor of
the hall. But she knew that it was to her side he was
coming, and she took the opportunity of flying when he
was compelled to make a pause in front of the flattery
of the Duchess of Ancaster.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>She was painfully shy at all times, but overwhelmingly
so at that moment, though she knew that she was
the only woman in the place who would make the attempt
to evade the distinction which threatened her.
How could she remain where she had been with all eyes
in the room upon her? She felt that it would be impossible.</p>

<p>Her heart was beating quickly as she thought:</p>

<p>“Not yet—not yet.”</p>

<p>After all there is no more womanly trait than that of
fleeing from a lover; but Fanny Burney was yielding to
its impulse without an attempt to analyse it, and without
being consoled by the reflection of the woman of the
younger world that if it is woman’s instinct to fly from
a lover, it is a lover’s instinct to pursue.</p>

<p>She had scarcely finished the cup of ice which her
cousin had brought her, before the man had found her.</p>

<p>But now the Gabrielli was beginning to sing, and all
eyes were directed upon the Gabrielli, so that no one
but Rauzzini saw how Dr. Burney’s over-shy daughter
was flushing.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<p>They spoke in French, with an occasional phrase
in Italian when they found the other tongue lacking
in melody or in the exact shade of meaning that
they sought to express. Edward Burney thought that
the moment was one that favoured his ambition to study
the pose of Madame Gabrielli, with a view to starting on
a portrait that should make him famous. He asked
Fanny’s permission to allow him to take up a place a few
yards beyond the pillar. He promised not to be long
absent, and Fanny had not the heart to detain him.</p>

<p>“You fled from me—was that kind?” asked Rauzzini
when the cousin had moved away, but was still in
view.</p>

<p>“Ah,” said she, “one who has my odious self-consciousness
does not ask what is kind or unkind, she
simply flies.”</p>

<p>“But you knew that I was coming to your side?”
said he.</p>

<p>“I know that you are wise enough to value the criticism
of a musician like my father above the vapid
phrases of the people of fashion,” replied Fanny.</p>

<p>“That is true indeed,” said he. “I value a word of
praise or blame from Dr. Burney as precious. But Dr.
Burney has a daughter whose words are to me as precious.”</p>

<p>“She is not here to-night,” said Fanny. “My sister
Esther, to whom you refer, is indeed a discriminating
critic. She told me how exquisitely you sang at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
concert where you met her—it is scarcely a fortnight
ago.”</p>

<p>“Dr. Burney has more daughters than that one,” said
he.</p>

<p>Fanny laughed.</p>

<p>“He has indeed more daughters than one,” she said.
“We were a household of daughters before Esther married
and when my brother was in the South Seas. But
only Esther is critical as a musician.”</p>

<p>“In the name of heaven, do you think that it is only
possible for me to value words that refer to my singing?”
he asked. “Do you not know that I would rather
listen to your voice than—”</p>

<p>“Than Madame Gabrielli’s?” said Fanny; he had
spoken his last sentence in too loud a tone, even though
the Gabrielli’s brilliant vocalism usually admitted of a
conversation being carried on with some vehemence in
the great room of the Pantheon without causing remark.</p>

<p>He smiled at her warning, and it was in a subdued
voice that he said:</p>

<p>“I am tired of hearing the Gabrielli; but what of your
voice? How often have you given me the chance of
hearing it? Even now you fled from me as though I
carried the plague about with me! Was that kind or
unkind?”</p>

<p>“You do not entertain the thought that perhaps I
have not yet tired of Madame Gabrielli’s vocalism: I
knew that she was at the point of beginning her aria.”</p>

<p>“You would sacrifice me on the altar of your favourite?
Well, perhaps you would be justified in doing so.
Hold up your finger now and I shall be mute as a fish
until Gabrielli has had her last shriek. I can still look
at you—it will not spoil your appreciation of the aria
if I merely look at you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>“I think I would rather that you talked to me than
merely looked at me. I do not invite people to look at
me, and happily few people do. I am not conspicuous
I am the insignificant one. There is Mrs. Thrale, for
instance; she has been several times at our house, and
every time she comes she inquires who is the little one.”</p>

<p>He smiled and held up his finger in imitation of the
way she had rebuked him for talking too loud.</p>

<p>“H’sh; I am anxious to hear the Signora Gabrielli,”
he said, and the expression that he made his face assume
at that moment would have convinced anyone that he
was giving all his attention to the singing—drinking in
every note with the earnestness of an enthusiast. There
was a certain boyish exaggeration in his expression that
was very amusing to Fanny, though less observing persons
would have been ready to accept it as evidence of
the generous appreciation on the part of one great
singer of the success of another.</p>

<p>So he remained until the <i lang="it">cavatina</i> had come to an end;
and then he was loudest in his cry of “Brava!”</p>

<p>“It is a treat—a great—a sacred treat,” said he,
turning to Fanny. “I do not think I ever heard that
song before. Has it a name, I wonder?”</p>

<p>“If I mistake not it is from an opera in which a certain
Roman tenore made a name for himself last year, in
happy conjunction with Madame Gabrielli,” said
Fanny.</p>

<p>“Is it possible? I had not heard of that circumstance,”
said he, with a look of the most charming innocence
in his large eyes. It was his hands that were
most expressive, however, as he added:</p>

<p>“But it was last year, you say, mademoiselle? Ah,
who is it that remembers an opera from one year to
another? No one, except the <i lang="it">impresario</i> who has lost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
his good money, or somebody’s else’s money, over its
production. Enough, the <i lang="it">cantatrice</i> has given us of her
best, and is there now any reason why we should remain
dumb? The great charm of the singing of these brilliant
artistes of last year’s operas is that when they have
sung, they have sung—they leave one nothing to think
about afterward. Is not that so, mademoiselle?”</p>

<p>“They leave one nothing to think about—except their
singing,” said Fanny. “For myself, I am still thinking
of ‘Waft her, angels,’ although nearly half an hour
must have passed since I heard the last notes. And it
seems to me that when half a century will have passed
I shall still be thinking of it.”</p>

<p>He did not offer her the conventional acknowledgment
of a bow. He only looked at her with those large eyes
of his; they were capable of expressing in a single glance
all the tenderness of feeling of a poem.</p>

<p>“I have not sung in vain,” he said in a low tone.
“My old <i lang="it">maestro</i> gave me the advice one day when I
was proving to him my success in reaching the high note
which I had been striving for years to bring into my
compass: ‘That is all very well,’ he said. ‘You have
aimed at touching that rare note, now your aim must
be to touch the heart of everyone who hears you sing.’
I sometimes think that he set for me too difficult a task.”</p>

<p>“Not too difficult—for you,” said she.</p>

<p>“There are dangers,” he said thoughtfully. “I have
known singers who tried to reach the hearts of their
hearers by tricks—yes, and they succeeded through these
illegitimate means in making themselves popular, while
far better singers who had a scorn of such tricks and
gave their best to all who listened to them, failed to
please anyone who had not a knowledge of the true
boundary of music.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>“I have seen these tricksters, too,” said Fanny. “I
have witnessed their sentimental grimaces—their head
shakings—their appeal to the feelings with pathetic
eyes turned heavenward. They made me ashamed of
them—ashamed of myself for listening to them, though
people about me had been moved to tears. But I think
that the people who are easily moved to tears are those
who retain an impression the shortest space of time.”</p>

<p>“You give me confidence—encouragement,” he cried.
“I have made up my mind that if I cannot reach a
heart by the straight King’s highway, I will not try to
do so by any bypath. Bypaths are, we know, the resorts
of brigands: they may captivate a heart or two, but only
to leave them empty afterwards.”</p>

<p>So they talked together for many minutes. Fanny
Burney had a sufficient acquaintance among musicians,
vocal as well as instrumental, to have learned, long ago,
that they can easily be prevented from talking on any
other subject than music, and the same reflection that
had caused her to say that “Not yet—not yet,” had impelled
her to lead Rauzzini in another direction than
that in which he had shown so strong a tendency to go.
He had been trying to make her understand that he had
travelled through the obstructions of the hall not in
order that he might obtain the criticism of so accomplished
a <i lang="it">maestro</i> as Dr. Burney upon his singing, but in
order that he should have a chance of talking to Dr.
Burney’s unaccomplished daughter; he had shown her
that his wish was to converse on the topic of this unaccomplished
daughter; but she had no mind to acquiesce
in his aims for the present. She still felt herself
to be the beggar maid, and she would not allow her king
to get any nearer to her.</p>

<p>It was not until her cousin had returned to where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
she was seated, that the young Italian found that he had
not made much progress with his suit. He had intended
that this <i lang="fr">tête-à-tête</i> with her should make her aware of
how he felt in regard to her, but he had allowed his
opportunity to pass, and in place of talking about her
he had been led to talk of himself.</p>

<p>That was how he expressed himself to her when he
found that their <i lang="fr">tête-à-tête</i> was at an end.</p>

<p>“How has this come about?” he cried in surprise.
“How is it that I have shown myself to be so vain as to
make speeches about my singing when I meant to talk
to you of yourself?”</p>

<p>“’Twas I who found a more profitable topic for you,
<i lang="it">signore mio</i>,” she replied, feeling her way through the
words of his native tongue, for he had spoken out his
surprise in Italian.</p>

<p>He shook his head and made a gesture with his hands.</p>

<p>“But it is a mystery!” he said in French. “I had
no desire to talk about myself or my singing. I meant
to tell you what was in my mind when I saw you entering
this place with your father. Shall we retrace our
steps in our conversation until I find how it was that I
took a wrong turning? Alas! I fear that it would not
be possible!”</p>

<p>“It would not be possible, indeed,” she replied.
“Did you not say something about the bypaths being
dangerous with banditti? We kept our feet upon the
King’s highway, which is safe. I was swept off my feet—carried
away—away—by your singing of the aria; I
had scarce touched the earth once more when you came
to my side, and now we are parting happily, you to
realize your aspirations, I to—to—well, to retain for
ever the memory of your singing—the memory of those
celestial harmonies into the midst of which I was wafted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
by the angels of your imploration. That is enough for
one evening of my life. Nay, you must not speak
another word lest the charm of all should fade away.
I shall go home to dream of angels.”</p>

<p>“And I shall go to dream of you,” he said in a low
tone.</p>

<p>He did not hold her hand so long as Thomas Barlowe
had done when parting from her, but she felt that somehow
he had accomplished more by his reserve than
Thomas had achieved by his impetuosity. She hoped
that she might never see Thomas again; but for Signor
Rauzzini—</p>

<p>They parted.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<p>“These foreigners!” exclaimed young Edward
Burney when Rauzzini had left them, and
Fanny was asking her cousin if her father was not
looking for her. “These foreigners! Your father is
talking with another of them—an Italian too, as I live—I
have seen him in St. Martin’s Street—Signor Piozzi.
But I suppose Uncle Burney likes to keep in touch with
them. The town is swarming with them: they are even
to be found about Leicester Fields. Why do some
people fancy that we must have Italians to sing for us?
There are plenty of good singers in England, without a
drop of foreign blood in their veins. A good sea song
with a chorus that is easy to get into the swing of—that’s
English and honest.”</p>

<p>“Honest down to the hoarsest note,” said Fanny.
“You and James are at one in the matter of songs.”</p>

<p>“Cousin Jim hates foreigners, as is quite proper that
an officer in a King’s ship should,” said Edward
stoutly.</p>

<p>“Not all foreigners,” said Fanny smiling. “You
forget how kindly he took to Prince Omai.”</p>

<p>“Oh, a South Sea Islander is different,” cried her
cousin. “I expect that the South Seas will soon become
as English as ourselves if Captain Cook goes on discovering
islands.”</p>

<p>“Edward,” said Fanny, after a pause sufficient to
allow of the introduction of a new topic; “Edward,
could you make it convenient to call at the Orange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
Coffee House some day soon to inquire if there is another
letter for Mr. Grafton?”</p>

<p>“I’ll not omit it on any account,” he replied. “Oh,
yes, Mr. Grafton, I’ll collect your correspondence for
you, never fear. You have not let anyone else into the
secret, I hope?”</p>

<p>“No one knows it except Susy and Lottie and Charles
and Hetty; but Hetty only knows that I wrote the book,
not that it is to be printed—Charles is still away from
us, or I would not trouble you, Edward.”</p>

<p>“Poor Charlie grew tired of the Orange Coffee House,
did he not? He told me how you made him your messenger
at first, disguising him in a cloak and a gentleman’s
hat, so that he might not seem quite the boy that
he was. But how the secret has been kept so well is a
wonder to me—kept from the powers that be, I mean—uncle
and aunt. I wonder if your mother never had a
suspicion of what was going on, especially as she knew
all about your writing long ago.”</p>

<p>“I think that it was the copying out of the padre’s
History that saved me,” said Fanny. “Many a page
of my novel I wrote when she believed that I was copying
the notes for the History—yes, that, and the letters
which Mr. Crisp insists on my sending him every week.
But even with these excuses I could sometimes not get
through more than three or four pages of my own book
during a whole week.”</p>

<p>“How will you look when the secret is let out—it
must be let out some day, you know? If the writing a
novel is thought shocking, how will Uncle Burney receive
the news, think you? He has not yet given you
leave to publish it.”</p>

<p>There was a troubled look on poor Fanny’s face as
she replied, after a pause:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>“I have often meant to ask father’s permission, but
I was not able to summon up courage enough to face
him with the whole truth. But it cannot be delayed
much longer. Perhaps I might write him a letter about
it some time when I am at Chessington.”</p>

<p>“I don’t envy you the duty, my dear Fanny,” said
he. “But I think that the sooner you get it over the
easier you will feel. I suppose that writing a novel is
worse than writing a ‘History of Music.’ I wonder
why you took so much trouble over the business.”</p>

<p>“I could not help it,” she cried. “I have often wondered
myself why I was sitting up in that cold room at
the top of the house, writing until my fingers were benumbed,
when I might have been at my comfortable
sewing in front of a fire downstairs; but I could not
help it—I could not help doing it, Eddy.”</p>

<p>Eddy never reached that point in his career as a
painter when he found the artist’s impulse to create
too great to be resisted. He could not appreciate
her explanation.</p>

<p>“‘I couldn’t help it,’ that’s what we were used to
say long ago, when we got into mischief; I hope that
Uncle Burney and Aunt Burney—don’t forget her in
this matter—I hope that they will accept your excuse.
Anyhow, you may trust me to act as your ‘Mr.
Grafton’ at the Orange Coffee House some day this
week.”</p>

<p>He caught a glimpse of his uncle, Dr. Burney, sitting
with Mr. Greville, so that he had no trouble in
placing Fanny once more in charge of her father. He
could see that the girl was a little downcast, and tried
to cheer her up a bit by whispering in a sly way into
her ear:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>“Good-night, Mr. Grafton; my best respects to Mrs.
Grafton and the children—especially Evelina.”</p>

<p>The smile that Fanny gave in acknowledgment of
his pleasantry did not quite carry conviction that his
well-meant effort had been successful. He went away
feeling as much sympathy for her as was possible for
him to have in common with the reflection that if she
was in a difficult position, it was wholly one of her
own seeking. What could have induced a girl who
had been carefully brought up, and provided with
an excellent stepmother, to write a novel, placing herself
thereby on a level with those dreadful ladies
whose productions were prohibited in every self-respecting
household and only read by stealth when obtained
at a cost of twopence—more than the best of
them were worth—at the circulating library?</p>

<p>Yes, poor Fanny was undoubtedly to be pitied; but
she had really only herself to blame for the trouble
that was looming in front of her when the secret of
her authorship should be revealed to her father and
her excellent stepmother—one of the best judges to
be found anywhere of all sorts of needlework—not
merely plain sewing and button-holing, but satin stitch,
herring-boning and running and felling.</p>

<p>The very next day Cousin Edward called at St.
Martin’s Street, carrying with him a small parcel neatly
done up in white paper. He was lucky enough to find
Fanny and Susan alone in the work-room; and after
asking mysteriously if there was any chance of his uncle
or aunt coming upon them, and being assured that they
were both away for the day, he carefully locked the door
of the room, saying in the whisper of a man of plots
and mysteries:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>“’Tis better to be sure than sorry. In matters of
this nature ’tis impossible to be too cautious.”</p>

<p>He then handed the parcel to Fanny, who gave an
exclamation when she saw that it was addressed:</p>

<p>“<i>To Mr. Grafton, at the Orange Coffee House, Orange
Street.</i>”</p>

<p>She opened the parcel, and found it to contain a
printer’s unbound copy of a book, the title page of
which stared up at her: “<cite>Evelina; or, A Young Lady’s
Entrance into the World</cite>,” and with it was a letter from
Mr. Lowndes, the bookseller, presenting his compliments
to Mr. Grafton, with the request that Mr. Grafton would
read the book and prove it as soon as possible, returning
the list of errata to Mr. Lowndes, so that the edition
might go to press for early publication.</p>

<p>There it lay on the table in front of her. She read
the letter standing, and remained on her feet, looking
down at the unbound book. It had a queer, half-dressed
appearance, lacking covers; and when, after
some minutes of silence, Susy took a step or two closer
to it, and, with her hand on Fanny’s arm, looked down
on it also, the picture that they made suggested two
sisters looking into the cradle where the first baby of
one of them lay. The expression on Susy’s face—a
mingling of wonder and curiosity, with delight not far
off—was exactly that which the younger sister of the
picture might be expected to wear, catching a glimpse of
the undressed morsel of humanity in its first cot.</p>

<p>Susy put her hand down to it, and moved the printed
sheets about. She read the title page down to the last
name on the imprint, and then she flung up her hands,
crying:</p>

<p>“How lovely! how lovely! But it seems wonderful!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
How did it come into being? It looks like a real thing
now that we see it printed. The copy that you wrote
out in that disguised hand seemed somehow quite different
from this. There is life in this. It feels warm,
actually warm, Fanny. Oh, don’t you love it, dear?”</p>

<p>Fanny, the young mother, shook her head, but with
no significance, so far as Susy could see.</p>

<p>“’Tis too late now,” said Edward gloomily, taking
on himself the burden of interpreting that head-shake.
“You are bound down to go on with it now. You
should have thought of all this before.”</p>

<p>“What nonsense is this you are talking?” cried Susy,
turning upon him almost indignantly; for his tone suggested
an aspersion upon the offspring. “What do
you say is too late now? Do you mean to say that
there’s anything to be ashamed of in this? Cannot you
see that she did not put her name to it? Who is there
to know that it came from this house? The name of
Burney nowhere appears on it.”</p>

<p>“That’s so much, at any rate,” said he.</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say that you don’t think it quite
wonderful, Eddy?” cried Susy. “And getting twenty
pounds for it—twenty pounds! And you say something
about it being too late!”</p>

<p>“I only judged from the way Fanny shook her head,”
said he.</p>

<p>“Oh, that was not what Fanny was thinking at all—now
was it, Fanny?” said Susy encouragingly to her
sister.</p>

<p>“I don’t know quite what I meant or what I mean
even now,” replied Fanny. “It made me feel for the
moment somehow as if I had appeared in a street full
of people before I had quite finished dressing!”</p>

<p>“Ah!” exclaimed Edward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>“But that is nonsense, dear,” said Susy, still consolatory.
“The book is not yourself.”</p>

<p>“Not all myself, but part of myself—that is what I
feel,” said Fanny.</p>

<p>“I cannot see that that is so. You are you—you
yourself quite apart from the book. Whatever the book
may be, you will still remain Fanny Burney, the best
daughter and the best sister in the world. What does
it matter if people—foolish people who know nothing
about it—laugh at it or say nasty things about it? Do
you think that that will make any of us like you the
less?”</p>

<p>She put her arm about Fanny and kissed her on the
cheek, and Fanny’s tears began to fall. The young man
standing by felt more uneasy than he had ever felt in
his life. He crossed the room and looked out of the
window, turning his back upon the scene of the sisters.
He did not know what to say to a girl when once she
allowed herself to weep. He wished with all his heart
that he had not been dragged into this business. But
Fanny’s tears convinced him that his first impression
of her reception of her book was the correct one: she
was, like other young mothers he had heard of, bitterly
repentant when it was too late.</p>

<p>The next sound of which he became aware was of the
crinkling of the stiff paper of the wrapper. One of
the girls was folding up the parcel. He glanced round
and saw that it was Fanny herself who was so engaged.
She had dried her tears; the expression on her face was
one of resignation—one of determination to make the
best of a bad matter.</p>

<p>“Ah, that’s better,” said he, going to her and picking
up the string from the floor. “There’s no use
crying over spilt milk, is there, Fanny? We have all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
kept your secret loyally, and no one need ever know
that you so far forgot yourself. Certainly the revelation
will never come from my lips.”</p>

<p>Fanny burst out laughing.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear Eddy, you are the best cousin that any
poor girl could have,” she said. “Your words have
helped me greatly. They have helped to make me feel
what is the aspect of the world in regard to my poor
little story. It has been my constant companion night
and day for three years and more. I worked at it in
the cold and I tried how I could improve pages of it,
copying it and recopying it; I practised a duplicity
which was foreign to my nature in writing it—I have
deceived my father and my mother about it—I wasted
my eyesight over it—I robbed myself of sleep so that I
might complete it, and when it was completed I lay
awake in anxiety lest no bookseller would look at it, all
this trouble I had with it, so that the world might have
of my best, and what is the verdict of the world after
all this? You have pronounced it, dear Eddy—you said
thoughtfully and consolingly—‘There’s no use crying
over spilt milk.’ You are quite right. Not another tear
will I shed over this poor little bantling of mine. ‘<cite>A
Young Lady’s Entrance into the World</cite>’? Nay, call it
rather a rickety brat that should never have made its
entrance into the world at all.”</p>

<p>“I should be ashamed of myself if I ever spoke of it
in such terms,” cried Susy, looking indignantly at her
cousin as though he had abused it in that phrase.
“‘Rickety brat,’ indeed! Oh, I should be ashamed. It
looked so much alive—more alive, I think, than if it
was in its covers. Let us sit down and read it together,
Fanny.”</p>

<p>Cousin Edward felt that he was being badly treated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
between these sisters. That last remark of Susy was
rather more than a suggestion that he might go as soon
as it pleased him. He had not any previous experience
of young women and their offspring. He could not
know that their attitude in such circumstances is one of
hostility to the male—that they resent his appearance
as an intrusion.</p>

<p>“I am glad that you are so pleased,” said he, with only
a trace of irritability in his voice. “And I am glad that
I have been of any use to you, Cousin Fanny. After
all, the thing is yours, not Susy’s.”</p>

<p>“That is true, indeed,” cried Fanny. “And it is I
who offer you my gratitude for your help. Believe me,
Eddy, I am sensible of the adroitness you have shown
in this matter ever since we let you into our secret; and
if any trouble comes from what we have done you may
be quite sure that I will accept the entire responsibility
for it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, so far as that goes, I do not shrink from taking
my share,” said he magnanimously. “I do not feel
quite without blame—I am a man and I should have
warned you at the outset. But you had nearly finished
it before I heard anything of it—you must not forget
that.”</p>

<p>“That is true indeed,” said Fanny. “I was self-willed.
I wonder was it vanity that impelled me.
Never mind! It cannot be helped now. It may never
be heard of again.”</p>

<p>“There’s always that to remember,” said he, with the
eagerness of a drowning man grasping at a straw.</p>

<p>“And I believe that the chances are greatly in favour
of that hope being realized. Thank you again for your
encouragement, dear Eddy,” said she.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s nothing—nothing worth talking about,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
said he, picking up his gloves. “You can command
me always, Cousin Fanny. And you have seen that I
can keep a secret. Now mind you don’t leave that lying
about”—he pointed to the parcel, the string of which
Susy was knotting—“and, be advised by me, turn the
key in the lock when you are working at it.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Susy, “we’ll be sure to do our best to
prevent anyone from suspecting that we have a secret,
by locking ourselves in.”</p>

<p>“Caution—nothing like caution,” said he in a whisper,
unfastening the door and putting his head out to glance
to right and left of the short corridor. He held up his
finger. “All safe so far,” he whispered; “no one is in
sight.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<p>The moment he disappeared, Susy slipped the knot
which she had just made on the parcel and flung
the paper away.</p>

<p>“Now we can settle down to it properly, Fanny,” she
cried, catching up the bundle of unstitched sheets and
throwing herself back upon the little sofa. “Come beside
me, dear, and we shall go through every word together.
Never mind what Eddy said; I think it looks
quite lovely, and how easily it reads—just like poetry—‘Evelina’!—how
did you think of that sweet name?—‘<cite>or,
A Young Lady’s Entrance into the World</cite>.’ Not a
mistake so far. The printers must surely be careful
men! And now that you come to think of it, this is
really the entrance of the Young Lady into the world.
Here she is, smiling, but a little shy—just like her mamma—your
Evelina takes after you, dear—now, confess
that there is something agreeably shy in the italics printing
of that line beginning with ‘<cite>A Young Lady’s Entrance</cite>,’
Fanny; it may be wrong to write a novel, but
don’t you think that this is worth it? Edward is a
goose to talk as he did about crying over spilt milk. I
wonder that you had patience to listen to him.”</p>

<p>“Eddy is a dear boy, and he only said what he knew
nearly everybody else would be disposed to say about
this business. I started the story, as you know, half in
fun—by way of exercising my hand—but then it got
hold of me, and it became deadly earnest, and now—oh,
Susy, what I feel now about it is just what I said to
Edward: it seems as if it were the best part of myself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
that I am giving to the world. I wonder if it is right
for anyone who has written a book, if it be only a novel,
to look upon it in that light.”</p>

<p>“Why should it not be right? Didn’t you put all
your thoughts into it, and are not one’s thoughts part
of oneself?” said Susy. “And although so many people
look down upon novels—all the novels that have been
written since Mr. Richardson died—still—oh, did not
Dr. Johnson once write a novel? Yes, ‘Rasselas’ was
what he called it. I tried to read it but—”</p>

<p>“H’sh, Susy. Dr. Johnson might write anything
that he pleased. Though Dr. Johnson wrote a novel,
that should be no excuse for such as I having the
audacity to do the like.”</p>

<p>“I suppose that’s what some people will say. But I
can’t see that if a good man does an evil thing, it becomes
a good thing simply because he does it.”</p>

<p>“Stop, Susy: I remember that he confessed to someone,
who told it to Mr. Crisp, that he had written ‘Rasselas’
in order to get money enough to pay for his
mother’s funeral.”</p>

<p>“Oh, in that case—might he not have written something
a good deal better, Fanny? Oh, I see that you are
stricken with horror at my thinking anything that came
from Dr. Johnson to be dull. I daresay I began reading
it too soon: I should have waited until I had learned
that if a great man writes a book it is a great book, but
that if a simple girl writes a novel—well, there’s no use
crying over spilt milk. Now that’s the last word that I
have to say, for I mean to read every word that’s printed
here—here—here!” She brought down her open hand
on the topmost sheets of “Evelina” in three crescendo
slaps, and then tucked her feet under her and buried herself
in the book.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>Fanny sat laughing beside her; and when Susy paid
no attention to her laughter, she continued sitting there
in silence, while Susy read page after page.</p>

<p>Several minutes had passed before the authoress
asked:</p>

<p>“How does the thing read, dear?”</p>

<p>Susy gave a start at the sound of her voice and looked
around her as if she had just been awakened. This
should have been enough for Fanny. She should not
have repeated her question: it was already answered.</p>

<p>“How does the thing read, Susy?”</p>

<p>“How does it read?” cried Susy. “Oh, Fanny, it
reads exactly like a book—exactly. There is no difference
between this and a real book. Oh, ’tis a
thousand times nicer to read in print than it was as you
wrote it. It is so good, too!—the best story I ever
read! I can’t understand how you ever came to write
it. You who have seen nothing of life—how did such a
story ever come to you?”</p>

<p>“I wish I knew,” replied Fanny. “And do you think
that anyone else will read it now that it is printed?”
she asked (she was rapidly acquiring the most prominent
traits of the complete novel writer).</p>

<p>“Anyone else? Nay, everyone—everyone will read
it, and everyone will love it. How could anyone help—even
daddy and mamma? Now please don’t interrupt
me again.”</p>

<p>Down went Susy’s face once more among the printed
sheets, and Fanny watched her with delight. She had
been quite ready a short time before to accept the verdict
of Cousin Edward as equivalent to that of the public
upon her book; and now she was prepared to accept
Susy as the representative of all readers of taste and
discrimination.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>“Edward—psha! What could he know about it?”
she was ready to exclaim: every moment was bringing
her nearer to the complete novelist.</p>

<p>“Surely,” she thought, “there can be no dearer
pleasure in life than to watch the effect of one’s own
book upon an appreciative reader!”</p>

<p>(The appreciative reader is always the one who is
favourably impressed; the other sort knows nothing
about what constitutes an interesting book.)</p>

<p>It was the first draught of which she had ever partaken
of this particular cup of happiness, and it was
a bombard. She was draining it to the very dregs:
it was making her intoxicated, even though it was only
offered to her by her younger sister, who had never
read half a dozen novels in all her life, and these surreptitiously.
She could know by the varying changes
in expression on Susy’s face what place she had come to
in the book: the turning over of the pages was no guide
to her, for she had no idea of the quantity of her writing
the printers had put into a page, but she had no
trouble in finding Susy’s place, so exquisitely reflective
was the girl’s face of the incidents among which she
was wandering. Surely little Susy had always been
her favourite sister (she was smiling at one of the
drolleries of characterization upon which she had
come); oh, there could be no doubt that she had never
loved any of her sisters as she loved Susy (Susy’s eyes
were now becoming watery, and Fanny knew that she
had reached the first of Evelina’s troubles).</p>

<p>It was the happiest hour of Fanny’s life, and she
gave herself up to it. She did not feel any irresistible
desire to judge for herself if the opinion expressed by
Susy respecting the story was correct or otherwise.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
She had no impulse to see how her ideas “looked in
print.” She was content to observe the impression they
were making upon her first lay reader. She had a
vague suspicion that her own pleasure in reading the
book would be infinitely less than the pleasure she derived
from following the course of the story in her
sister’s face.</p>

<p>Half an hour had actually passed before Susy seemed
to awaken to the realities of life. She jumped up from
the sofa with an exclamation of surprise, and then
glanced down at Fanny with an inquiring look on her
face—a puzzled look that gave the seal to Fanny’s happiness.</p>

<p>“You are wondering how I come to be here, Susy,”
said she smiling. “You are wondering how I come to
be mixed up with the Branghtons and the Mervains and
the rest of them. You would make me out to be an enchantress
carrying you into the midst of a strange society;
and I don’t want any more delightful compliments,
dear.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Fanny, ’tis so wonderful—so—”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to hear anything about it beyond what
you have already told me, my dear Susy. I watched
your face and it told me all. Give me a kiss, Susy.
You have given me a sensation of pleasure such as I
never knew before, and such as, I fear, I shall never
know again.”</p>

<p>In an instant the two girls were in each other’s arms,
mingling their tears and then their laughter, but exchanging
no word until they had exhausted every other
means of expressing what they felt.</p>

<p>It was Susy who spoke first.</p>

<p>“Take it away, Fanny,” she said. “Take the book<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
away, for I know that if I read any more of it I shall
betray your secret to all the house. They will read it
on my face every time I look at you.”</p>

<p>“I think that the hour has come for me to relieve
you of the precious book,” said Fanny. “There is the
letter from Mr. Lowndes asking me to make out the list
of errata as quickly as possible, and I do believe that I
shall have to read the book before I can oblige him.”</p>

<p>“’Twas thoughtless for me to jump into the middle
as I did, when you had to read it,” cried Susy. “But
there is really no mistake on any page, so far as I could
see.”</p>

<p>“Unless the whole is a mistake,” said Fanny. “But
I will not suggest that now, having seen your face while
you were devouring it. Dear Susy, if I find many
such readers I shall be happy.”</p>

<p>She gathered together the loose sheets and carried
them off to the little room at the top of the house where
it was understood she wrote her long weekly letter to
Mr. Crisp, who had made himself a hermit at Chessington,
but who, like some other hermits, looked forward
with impatience to the delightful glimpses of the world
which he had forsaken, afforded to him on every page
written by her.</p>

<p>Susy did not see her again until dinner-time, and by
that time the younger girl felt that she had herself under
such complete control that she could preserve inviolate
the secret of the authorship until it should cease to be
a secret. The result of her rigid control of herself was
that her brother James said to her when they were having
tea in the drawing-room:</p>

<p>“What was the matter with you at dinner, Sue?
You looked as if you were aware that something had
happened and you were fearful lest it might be found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
out. Have you broken a china ornament, or has the cat
been turning over the leaves of the ‘History of Music’
with her claws, and left her signature on the morocco
of the cover?”</p>

<p>“What nonsense!” cried Susan. “Nothing has happened.
What was there to happen, prithee tell me?”</p>

<p>“Ah, that is beyond my power,” he replied. “I
suppose you girls will have your secrets—ay, ay; until
some day you reveal them to another girl with the
strictest of cautions never to let the matter go beyond
her—and so forth—and so forth. Never mind, I’ll not
be the one to tempt you to blab. I never yet had a
secret told to me that was worth wasting words over.”</p>

<p>“If I had a secret of importance I think that you
would be a safe person to tell it to,” said Susy.</p>

<p>“You are right there,” he assented with a nautical
wink. “You could find in me the safest depository
you could wish for; you might safely depend upon my
forgetting all about it within the hour.”</p>

<p>He did not trouble her any further, but she felt somewhat
humiliated to think that she had had so little
control of herself as to cause her brother’s suspicions to
be aroused. She thought that it would only be a matter
of minutes when her father or her stepmother would
approach her with further questions. Happily, however,
it seemed that James was the keenest observer in
the household, for no one put a question to her respecting
her tell-tale face.</p>

<p>Still she was glad when she found herself safely and
snugly in bed and so in a position to whisper across the
room to her sister Charlotte the news that Fanny’s
novel had been printed and that a copy was safely locked
up in Fanny’s desk, and that it looked lovely in its
new form.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>Charlotte was greatly excited, but thought that Fanny
might have told her the news before dinner.</p>

<p>“Poor Fanny! she will have to tell the Padre to-morrow
and ask his leave to—to do what she has already
done without it. Poor Fanny!”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<p>A few days later Dr. Burney was at the point of
setting out for Chessington to share Mr. Crisp’s
hermitage until the end of the week. He had already
said good-bye to the household; but Fanny accompanied
him to the door. It was her last chance, she knew. She
had long ago made up her mind that one of her secrets
must be told to him, and she had more than once, since
the printed sheets had been brought to her, tried to
screw up her courage to the point of telling him, but
she had not yet succeeded. And now he was going to
Chessington for four days, and in the meantime the
book should be returned to the printer. It was the last
chance she would have of discharging the duty which
was incumbent on her. She had been hovering around
him in the hall, shaking out his gloves for him,
polishing the gold knob of his cane, picking a scrap of
dust from the collar of his travelling-cloak. In another
minute he would be gone—her opportunity would be
gone.</p>

<p>And then came the relieving thought of further procrastination:</p>

<p>“I shall write to him at Chessington and confess all.”</p>

<p>It seemed as though she had uttered her thought aloud,
for he turned to her with his hand on the latch of the
hall door, saying:</p>

<p>“You will write to Chessington to-morrow or the day
after, my dear. It is no trouble to you to write. You
enjoy it, do you not?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, it is my chief enjoyment. That is why I have
been practising it so much, just as the others have been
practising their music. I have no music in my soul,
so I—I have been writing. Of course, it is not to be
expected that I could do more than write some nonsense—my
equivalent to the strumming of the scales.”</p>

<p>“It pleases me greatly to hear that,” said he. “But
you do yourself an injustice; Mr. Crisp never ceases
to praise your letters.”</p>

<p>“He is praising his own pupil then,” said she, “for
’twas he who first taught me how to write, and now I
have been putting together some imaginary letters, and
I thought that if he could see them printed in front of
him he would be amused.”</p>

<p>“Imaginary letters? Why not continue your real
ones, my dear? It would cost a great deal to have your
imaginary ones printed.”</p>

<p>“My dear father,” she cried, “you surely do not think
that I would ask you for money to pay for my whim?
But if I could prevail on someone—a bookseller—to
print what I write, I hope you will consent to my doing
so—not putting my name to the thing, of course?”</p>

<p>“And does my Fanny believe that ’tis all so easy to
persuade a bookseller to pay her printer’s bill?” he said,
pinching her ear. “Booksellers are shrewd men of
business.”</p>

<p>“But even men of business have their weak moments,”
said she. “And so if—if—you would not think it too
bold of me to let James take my parcel to a bookseller?
You would not forbid me to try to realize my ambition?”</p>

<p>“You may be sure that the one to frustrate your aims
will not be your father,” said he, smiling shrewdly.
“I will consent if—ah, there is the fatal if—if your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
bookseller consents. Now good-bye, my dear child. I
will take your love to your Daddy Crisp, and tell him
to await a real letter from you—not an imaginary one.”</p>

<p>She stood on tiptoe to kiss him—but even then he had
to stoop before his lips were on her forehead.</p>

<p>He was gone in another moment. She stood at the
inner side of the closed door and listened to the rattling
of the wheels of the chaise over the cobble-stones.</p>

<p>So the ordeal that she dreaded had been faced, and
how simple a thing it had turned out after all! Her
father had treated the idea which she had submitted to
him as if it were nothing beyond the thought of a simpleton—a
foolish, simple girl who knew nothing of the
world of business and booksellers, and who fancied that
a bookseller would print everything that was sent to
him.</p>

<p>He had delivered that contingent “if” with the shake
of the head and the shrewd smile of one who is acquainted
with the seamy side of business, in the presence
of a child who fancies that printing follows automatically
upon the writing of a book and that there are
thousands of buyers eagerly awaiting the chance of
securing everything that passes through a printing-press.
She had perceived just what was in his mind;
and his consent, followed by that contingent “if,” to
her publishing what she had written, was given to her
with the same freedom that would have accompanied
his permission to appropriate all the gold used in paving
the streets of the City. She could see from the way
he smiled that he felt that she knew as little about the
conditions under which books are printed as a child
does about the paving of the streets of the City.</p>

<p>She knew that he would never again refer to the subject
of those imaginary letters of hers—he would be too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
considerate of her feelings to do so; he would have no
desire to humiliate her. He would not even rally her
in a playful way about her literary work, asking her
how the printing was progressing, and if she had made
up her mind to start a coach as grand as that magnificent
piece of carved and gilded furniture which Sir
Joshua had just had built for himself—oh, no: her
father had always respected her sensibility. Years ago,
when her brothers and sisters were making their light
jests upon her backwardness, he had stopped them and
said that he had no fears for the future of Fanny; and
she was certain that in referring to her, as he so frequently
did, as “poor Fanny,” he meant nothing but
kindness to her. To be sure, at first it grated upon her
sensitiveness to be referred to in that kindly pitying
way, but she did not resent it—indeed, she usually
thought of herself as “poor Fanny.” In a household
where proficiency in music was the standard from which
every member was judged, it was inevitable that her
incompetence should be impressed upon her; but no one
was hard upon her—the kindly “poor Fanny” of her
father represented the attitude of the household toward
her, even when she had confided to some of the members
the fact that she was writing a novel. They had been
startled; but, then, a novel was not a musical composition,
and such an achievement could not be received with
the warmth that Esther’s playing received. It was
really not until the printed sheets of the book lay before
Susy that she felt that Fanny had, in one leap, brought
herself wellnigh to the level of Esther; and by the time
Susy had read the story to the end she had made up her
mind that if it might be possible to compare the interest
of a literary work with that of the playing of a piece
of music, Fanny’s work could claim precedence over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
best that Esther had done—she had confessed as much
to Fanny in secret, and Fanny had called her a foolish
child.</p>

<p>Fanny had seated herself in the parlour opening off
the little hall, on the departure of her father, and her
memory took her back to the days she had passed in the
house at Poland Street, when she had written her story
of Caroline Evelyn, and had been induced by her stepmother
to burn it, with sundry dramas and literary
moralizings after the manner of the <cite>Tatler</cite>—all the
work of her early youth. She recalled her resolution
never again to engage in any such unprofitable practices
as were represented by the smoke which was ascending
from the funeral pyre of her “Caroline Evelyn” and
the rest.</p>

<p>How long had she kept to her resolution? She could
not remember. She could not recall having any sense
of guilt when she had begun her “Evelina”—it seemed
to have sprung from the ashes of “Caroline Evelyn”—nor
could she recollect what had been on her mind when
she was spending those long chilly hours of her
restricted leisure toiling over the book. All that she
could remember now was her feeling that it had to be
written—that it seemed as if someone in authority had
laid on her the injunction to write it, and she had no
choice but to obey.</p>

<p>Well, she had obeyed—the book had been written and
printed and she meant to send the corrected sheets back
to Mr. Lowndes in the course of the day. Her father’s
consent to its publication had been obtained and it would
be advertised for sale within some months, and then—</p>

<p>Her imagination was not equal to the pursuit of the
question of its future. Sometimes she felt that she never
wished to hear of the book again. She could almost hope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
that sending the sheets back to Mr. Lowndes would be
the same as dropping them, with a heavy stone in the
parcel, into the deep sea.</p>

<p>But that was when the trouble of getting her father’s
permission to publish it was looming before her. Now
that this cloud had been dispelled she felt less gloomy.
She had a roseate dream of hearing people talk about
the book and even wishing to know the name of the
author. She had a dream of Fame herself carrying her
away to sublime heights—to such heights as she had been
borne by the singing of “Waft her, Angels.” Her
dream was of sitting on these heights of Fame by the
side of the singer—on the same level—not inferior in
the eyes of the world—not as the beggar maid uplifted
in her rags to the side of the King.</p>

<p>That had been her dream when listening to the singing,
and it returned to her now, as she sat alone in the
little parlour, having just taken the last step that was
necessary before giving to the world the book which
was to do so much for her. Her visions of success
showed her no more entrancing a prospect than that of
being by his side with her fame as a dowry worthy of his
acceptance at her hands; so that people might not say
that he had chosen unworthily—he, who had all the
world to choose from.</p>

<p>And quite naturally there came to her in due sequence
the marvellous thought that he had already chosen her
out of all the world—he had chosen her, believing her
to be the dowerless daughter of a music-teacher—the
one uninteresting member of a popular family!</p>

<p>This was the most delightful thought of the whole
train that came to her. It was worth cherishing above
all the rest—close to her heart—close to her heart. She
hugged that thought so close to her that it became warm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
with the warmth of her heart. Even though her book
should never be heard of again, even though the world
might treat it with contempt, she would still be consoled
by the reflection that he had chosen her.</p>

<p class="tb">“Why on earth should you be sitting here in the cold,
Fanny?” came the voice from the opened door—the
voice of firm domestic virtue.</p>

<p>“Cold? cold? Surely ’tis not cold, mamma,” she
said.</p>

<p>“Not so very cold; but when there is a fire in the
work-room it should not be wasted,” said Mrs. Burney.
“But to say the truth you do not look as if you were
cold; your face is quite flushed, child. I hope you do
not feel that you are on the brink of a sickness, my
dear.”</p>

<p>“Dear mamma, I never felt stronger in my life,”
cried Fanny with a laugh.</p>

<p>“I am glad to hear that. I was saying to Lottie just
now that for some days past you have had alternately
a worried look and the look of one whose brain is over-excited.
Is anything the matter, my child?”</p>

<p>“Nothing—nothing—indeed nothing! I never felt
more at ease in all my life.”</p>

<p>“Well, well, a little exercise will do you no harm, I
am sure; so put on your hat and accompany me to the
fishmonger’s. He has not been treating us at all fairly
of late. It is not that I mind the remark made quite
respectfully by James at dinner yesterday—it would be
ridiculous to expect to find fish as fresh in the centre
of London as he and his shipmates were accustomed to
in the middle of the Pacific Ocean; but it would not
be unreasonable for us to look for turbot with less of
a taint than that we had yesterday. You will hear the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
man excuse himself by asserting that I chose the fish
at his stall; but my answer to that—well, come with me
and you shall hear what is my answer.”</p>

<p>Fanny went with her and heard.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<p>The faithful Cousin Edward had carried the sheets
of “Evelina” to Mr. Lowndes’s shop, with her
list of errata, sisters Lottie and Susy giving him ample
instructions as to the disguise he should assume in discharging
that duty; it would be terrible, they thought,
if the secret which they had so carefully guarded for
so long should be revealed just when it was most important
that it should be kept. Their imagination was
keen enough to suggest to them the possibility of good
Mr. Lowndes setting a watch upon the people entering
his shop, and giving instructions that the bearer of the
parcel of “Evelina” should be detained and brought
into his presence to be questioned.</p>

<p>They advised that Edward should muffle up his face
well before going into the shop, and then lay down his
parcel and fly like the wind—that would be the best
way of defeating the curiosity of the bookseller.</p>

<p>But Edward was of the opinion that such a course of
action might possibly only stimulate the man’s curiosity
as well as that of the people in the street, and the cry
of “Stop thief!” might bring his frantic flight to a
standstill. He thought that the most artful course to
adopt would be to hang around the shop until he found
that several customers were within; then he would enter
quite casually and wait until Mr. Lowndes had served
one customer and was about to attend to another. If
the parcel were thrust into his hands during this interval,
he, Edward, would have a good chance of getting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
safely away before Mr. Lowndes should have time to
examine its contents.</p>

<p>They were rather struck with his idea, and he got
permission to put it into practice; but in any case he
must take the greatest care of the parcel; valuable
parcels were snatched out of people’s hands every day.</p>

<p>He smiled.</p>

<p>In another hour he was back at the house in St.
Martin’s Street to report to them the safe delivery of
the precious parcel. After all, he had had nothing more
exciting to do than to place it on a counter—the elderly
gentleman with a pen behind his ear had not even taken
the trouble to rise from his stool to receive it.</p>

<p>“Parcel for Mr. Lowndes? All right. Leave it
there”—those were the exact words with which the
parcel was received, Edward reported—the clerk was
buried in his ledger before he had left the shop.</p>

<p>The girls were not a little disappointed at this very
tame conclusion of what they expected would have been
an exciting episode; and to say the truth, their chagrin
was shared by Cousin Edward. He had looked for his
resources of artfulness to be drawn on in the transaction—perhaps
even his physical qualifications for the defence
of the sacred secret as well. He felt as a strong man
might feel on going forth to meet a giant, to find himself
confronted by a dwarf. The mission was unworthy of
his powers. Fanny’s thanks heartily given to him, with
the repeated assurance that, but for him, the affair could
never have been carried out, scarcely compensated him
for the tameness of the affair.</p>

<p>For the next month or two it was a busy household in
St. Martin’s Street. Lieutenant Burney was joining his
ship for another long voyage, and he had to be provided
with a fresh outfit. The stitching that went on in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
work-room surpassed even that maintained during the
months preceding Esther’s marriage; but the labour was
lightened upon more than one occasion by the appearance
of Mr. Garrick. Mr. Garrick had the freedom of
the house in St. Martin’s Street, as he had had that of
the Poland Street domicile, where he had so often spent
hours amusing the children with his inimitable drolleries.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Burney thought he went a little too far in
taking off their friends, and even their own father,
though his malicious touches were as light as the pinches
of Puck. He had been paying a visit to Mr. and Mrs.
Kendal, and he convulsed even Mrs. Burney by his acting
of the scene of his reception by them, the lady much more
coy than she had ever been at the Wells, and the gentleman
overflowing in his attentions to her; but both of
them esteeming him as their benefactor.</p>

<p>And they were so well satisfied with the honourable
estate to which he had called them, that they appeared
to be spending all their time trying to bring about
matches among their acquaintance. No matter how unsuitable
some of the projected unions seemed, no matter
how unlikely some of the people were to do credit to their
discrimination, they seemed determined that none should
escape “the blissful bondage”—that was Mr. Kendal’s
neat phrase. Mr. Garrick repeated it with a smile that
made his audience fancy that Mr. Kendal was before
them.</p>

<p>“‘The blissful bondage—that’s what I term it, sir,’”
said Mr. Kendal, through Mr. Garrick. “‘But the
worst of the matter is, Mr. Garrick, that we have nearly
exhausted our own circle of friends’—‘I can easily believe
that, sir,’ interposed Mr. Garrick—‘and so we feel
it our duty to fall back upon you.’ ‘Lud, sir,’ cried Mr.
Garrick, jumping a step or two back as if to avoid a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
heavy impact—‘Lud, sir! a little man like me! I should
be crushed as flat as a black beetle.’ ‘Nay, sir, I mean
that we are compelled to ask you for a list of a few of
your friends who, you think, should be brought together—half
a dozen of each sex would be sufficient to begin
with.’”</p>

<p>“Of course I demurred,” said Garrick, telling his
story, “but before ‘the blissful bondage’ had been repeated
more than a score of times I began to think of all
against whom I bore a grudge—here was clearly the
means of getting level with them; the only trouble with
me was that I found myself confounding the people who
bore me a grudge with those against whom I bore a
grudge—the former are plentiful, the latter very meagre
in number. With the exception of a few very dear animosities
which I was hoarding up to make old age endurable,
I have killed off all my enemies, and was forced, like
Mr. Kendal, to fall back on my friends; but even among
these I could find few that I could honestly say were deserving
of such a fate as I was asked to nominate them
for. I ventured, however, to mention the name of Lieutenant
Burney, of His Majesty’s Fleet, coupling it with—I
could not at first think of an appropriate partner for
James, but at last I hit upon exactly the right lady.”</p>

<p>“What! a splice before I set sail next week?” cried
Jim. “That’s good news, sir. And the lady’s name, if
you please, and her address. Give me my hat, Susy;
there is no time to be lost. A splice in a trice. Come,
Mr. Garrick, her name? Cannot you see that I am hanging
in stays until you tell me who she is?”</p>

<p>“She is a very pleasant lady, sir. I can assure you
of that,” said Garrick. “Not too tall even with her hair
built <i lang="fr">à la mode</i>; a pleasant smile, and a happy way of
conversing. In short, Lieutenant Burney, I can strongly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
recommend the lady, for I have known her for the past
twenty years and more, and from the first she was a
staid, sensible person—the very partner for a sailor, sir,
being so contrary to him in every point.”</p>

<p>“Hark’ee, Mr. Garrick; though I don’t quite see
myself in tow of such a state barge, I’ll trouble you to
relieve my suspense by telling me her name.”</p>

<p>“I have more than once thought when I was young
that she would make me an excellent wife,” said Garrick;
“but I soon perceived that I was not good enough
for her. She has always been an exemplary sister, and
I saw that, try as I might, I could never become her equal
in that respect; and for married happiness, my boy, there
is nothing like—”</p>

<p>“Her name—her name?” shrieked the girls.</p>

<p>The actor looked at them with pained surprise on every
feature.</p>

<p>“Her name?” he said. “Surely I have described her
very badly if you have not recognized the portrait. But,
for that matter, I have often felt how inadequate are
words to describe character combined with grace—a
nature inclined to seriousness in conjunction with a
desire to attract—loftiness of purpose linked with a certain
daintiness—”</p>

<p>He made a few gestures with his hands, keeping his
elbows close to his side, and then imitated the spreading
of a capacious skirt preparatory to sinking in a curtsey,
and in a moment there was a cry from every part of the
room of “Miss Reynolds—Miss Reynolds!”</p>

<p>“And who has a word to say against Miss Reynolds?”
cried the actor.</p>

<p>“No one—no one,” said Fanny. “Character combined
with grace—Miss Reynolds linked with Lieutenant
Burney.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>“She would make a fine sheet anchor for an Admiral
of the Blue,” laughed Jim. “And with your permission,
sir, I will postpone my offer until I have attained
that rank.”</p>

<p>“I have advised Mr. Kendal to hurry things on,” said
Garrick gravely. “For if you have time to spare before
making up your mind, the lady cannot reasonably be
thought equally fortunate. ‘Lieutenant Burney, your
attitude is not complimentary to the blissful bondage’”—once
more it was Mr. Kendal who was in the room.</p>

<p>“Call the roll,” said Jim. “Who comes next on your
list, Mr. Garrick?”</p>

<p>“Well, I was thinking of Dr. Johnson with Mrs. Abington,”
said Garrick; “but perhaps you may quibble even
at that.”</p>

<p>The room rang with laughter, for everyone had seen
the beautiful actress whose lead in dress was followed
by all the ladies in the fashionable world who could
afford to do so, and a greater number who could not; and
the worsted hose and scorched wig, two sizes too small,
of Dr. Johnson had been gazed at with awe by the Burney
family when he visited the house in St. Martin’s Street.</p>

<p>“Let the banns be published without delay,” cried
Jim. “Next pair, please.”</p>

<p>“Well, I was thinking of Signor Rauzzini and Mrs.
Montagu,” said Garrick, “but perhaps that would not
be approved of by you any more than the others.”</p>

<p>“Nay, Mr. Garrick, I will not have our friends made
any longer the subject of your fooling,” said Mrs. Burney.</p>

<p>Garrick and Jim had the laugh between them, but it
seemed that they alone saw the jest of coupling the lively
Roman with the mature leader of the bluestockings: the
girls bent silently over their work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>“Madam,” said Garrick apologetically, “I ask your
pardon for my imprudence. May I ask which name I
am to withdraw? Was my offence the introduction of
the lady’s name or the gentleman’s? Oh, I can guess.
Those rosy-tinted faces before me—I vow that you will
find yourself going to sea with a chestful of pink shirts,
Lieutenant—those sweet blushing faces reveal the secret
more eloquently than any words could do.”</p>

<p>Undoubtedly the three girls were blushing very
prettily; but at the mention of the word “secret” two
of them gave a little start, but without looking up.</p>

<p>“The secret—oh, I have been feeling for some time
that I was well to the leeward of a secret,” cried Jim,
“and I’ll not start tack or sheet until I learn what it is.”</p>

<p>“What, sir; you a sailor and not able to penetrate the
secret of a pretty girl’s blushes!” cried Garrick.</p>

<p>The brother looked at each of his sisters in turn. They
continued stitching away demurely at his shirts.</p>

<p>“Helm’s a-lee,” he said. “Ready about, and off we
go on another tack, for hang me if I see anything of guilt
on their faces, bless ’em! Come, Mr. Garrick, you shall
interpret them for me. Let me into the secret which
you say you have read as if it was a book.”</p>

<p>Susy gave a sharp cry.</p>

<p>“The needle!” she said. “That is the third time it
has pricked me since morning.”</p>

<p>“Pay no attention to her, sir,” cried Garrick. “It
was a feint on her part to put us off the scent of the
secret.”</p>

<p>“In heaven’s name, then, let us have it,” cried Jim.</p>

<p>“If you will have it, here it is,” said Garrick. “Your
three sisters, Mr. Burney, are contemplating applying to
Mrs. Montagu to be admitted to the freedom and the
livery of the Society of Bluestockings. That is why they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
thought it akin to sacrilege for me to introduce the lady’s
name into a jest. Their blush was but a reflex of their
guilty intention.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, Mr. Garrick, you go too far sometimes,” said
Mrs. Burney. “Mrs. Montagu is a worthy lady, and our
girls respect her too highly to fancy that they have any
qualification to be received into her literary set.”</p>

<p>“Faith, Madam, I know my duty too well, I hope, to
accuse any of the Miss Burneys of possessing literary
qualities,” said Garrick. “But what I do say is that if
such qualities as they possess were to be introduced into
Mrs. Montagu’s set, it would quickly become the most
popular drawing-room in town. The idea of thinking
that any young woman would go to the trouble of writing
a book when she can reach the heart of mankind so much
more easily by blushing over the breast of a shirt!
Continue stitching and doing your own blushing, dear
children, and you will never give anyone cause to blush
for you.”</p>

<p>He bowed elaborately to each of them in turn and
afterward to Mrs. Burney, and made a most effective
exit. He always knew when he should go, and never
failed to leave a few fragrant phrases behind him, as
though he had dropped a bunch of roses for the girls to
cherish.</p>

<p>“Where should we be without Mr. Garrick?” said
James, when he had seen the actor to the door and
returned to the work-room.</p>

<p>“If only he would not go too far in his jesting,” remarked
Mrs. Burney, shaking her head. “Mr. Garrick
sometimes forgets himself.”</p>

<p>“That is how it comes that he is the greatest actor in
the world,” said James. “It is only when a man has
learned to forget himself completely that he causes everyone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
else to remember him. Now there’s the text for a
homily that you can write to your Daddy Crisp, Fanny.”</p>

<p>“I’ll note it, Jim, and if Mr. Crisp breaks off correspondence
with me you shall bear the blame,” said
Fanny.</p>

<p class="tb">“Mercy on us!” whispered Susy when she was alone
with her sister a little later. “I never got such a fright
as when Mr. Garrick pretended to read your secret.
Thank goodness! he failed to get the least inkling of it.”</p>

<p>“Thank goodness, indeed!” whispered Fanny.</p>

<p>But she was thinking of quite a different secret when
she spoke.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<p>He was beside her before she was aware of it, in the
great music-room at Lady Hales’s house. She had
not seen him approach her—she could not have done so
without turning round, for he had approached her from
behind, and slipped into the chair that Esther had
vacated in order to play to the company. Esther’s husband,
who had been in the seat beyond her, had been led
away some time earlier by Mr. Linley’s clever son in
order that he might give an opinion respecting one of
the songs in a piece named <cite>The Duenna</cite>, which was about
to be produced at Drury Lane.</p>

<p>He was beside her and whispering in her ear, though
she had not even known that he was to be present.</p>

<p>Of course he went through the pantomimic form of
inquiring how it was that she was alone—this was, she
knew, for the benefit of anyone who might be watching
them and suspect an assignation. The idea of anyone
seriously fancying that Dr. Burney’s daughter would
have an assignation with Signor Rauzzini in such a place
and in the midst of such a company! But Signor Rauzzini
came from a land of intrigue, and his experience of
England led him to believe that he had come to another;
and so he made those gestures of inquiry, and she gave
him a few words of explanation, so that no one might
suspect! But, for that matter, their chairs were in the
least conspicuous place in the room, and the shadow of
the heavy hangings of a window fell half across them
both.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>“And we have not met for months,” said he in French.</p>

<p>“Nay, have you forgotten our evening at the Pantheon?”
she asked.</p>

<p>“Forgotten it? But that is months ago—ages. And
it was all unfinished—broken off: when at its best—mutilated.
That hour we had! Oh, was it a melody suddenly
interrupted when it was approaching its best?
Was it a poem snatched away by some ruthless hand just
when we had begun a deathless line?”</p>

<p>“What I remember best is your singing of ‘Waft her.’
I am not quite sure that I have yet returned to the earth
from those regions whither I felt myself wafted. Are
you conscious of having any part in <cite>Dido</cite> into which you
can throw yourself with the same spirit?”</p>

<p>“<cite>Dido!</cite> pah! <cite>Dido</cite> is a paltry playhouse—Maestro
Handel’s work is a Sistine Chapel—ah, more—more—a
noble cathedral. When other composers built their garden
houses in imitation of Greek temples, he spent all
his time raising cathedrals. His genius is his own—mighty—overpowering!
Every time I approach the
great <i lang="it">maestro</i> I feel that I should put off my shoes from
my feet. It is holy ground—it is—ah, mademoiselle, it
was you who led me to chatter of myself and my music
when we were last together, and I had no wish to do so;
I meant to talk of yourself alone, but we had parted
before I had the chance again. I have been wondering
ever since if such a chance would return—if I had not
thrown it away; and now you have lured me once more
toward the golden net of music; but I have seen it
spread: I will not step into it. I want to talk to you of
love—love and you—and—me.”</p>

<p>He had restrained his voice so that it was no more
than a whisper, and he had chastened his gestures until
he seemed rigid. Fanny knew that even if their chairs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
had not been far away from the next that were occupied,
his words could reach no ears but her own; but the effort
that he was making to restrain his gestures—oh, was it
not more significant to any observant eye than his most
florid action would have been? With bent head she was
conscious of the quivering of the muscles of his clenched
hands—of the tremulous earnestness of his expressive
face. Surely everyone who so much as glanced at him
would know what was the subject of his discourse—and
hers—hers—but what should hers be? What answer was
she to make to such a man whispering such a word as
love?</p>

<p>“I am afraid,” she said. “You make me afraid. Is
this the place? Is this the time? Am I the one?”</p>

<p>“Every place is the place—every time is the time—and
you—you are the only one,” said he, becoming more
fervent every moment. “If you and I were alone—but
we are alone—our love isolates us—we are alone in the
splendid isolation of our love. What are these people
who are about us? They are nothing to us—less than
nothing. What are the people in a church to the devout
one who enters and keeps his eyes fixed upon the lovely
face of the saint to whom he prays. The saint and he
are in communion together, and their communion isolates
them though the church is crowded? I keep my eyes of
devotion upon your face, my beautiful saint, and I am
rapt with the glory of this hour—we are carried away on
the wings of our love until the world is too far beneath
us to be seen—only the heaven is revealed to us—to me—I
look into your face and I have a glimpse of heaven
itself! Ah, gentle saint, you will not deny me a response—one
word—only lift up your eyes—let our eyes meet
and it will be as if our lips had met. I am but a mortal,
but I feel, gazing into the face of my saint, as if I were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
immortal—immortal and crossing the threshold of the
heaven that is hers—I feel that we are equal—”</p>

<p>She drew in her breath—the sound was something like
a gasp—the gasp of one who has been swept away into
the midst of a swirling sea and made breathless. She had
been swept away on the amazing flood of his words; it
was not until he had said that word “equal” that she
felt herself swirled into the air once more, so to speak,
and gave that gasp for breath: he, too, was breathless
after his long and fervid outburst, repressed as to tone,
but sounding therefore all the more passionate. Her
gasp sounded like a sigh; his like a sob.</p>

<p>“Not yet—not yet,” she said in a whisper—disjointed
and staccato. “I cannot listen to you yet. I dare not—I
have my pride.”</p>

<p>“Pride? What is pride? How have I wounded your
pride?” he said. “Ah, my God! you cannot think that I
would propose anything that is not honourable? You
do not look on me as such a wretch? Ah, you cannot.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, no,” she said quickly. “I would trust you.
I have looked into your face. I have heard you sing.”</p>

<p>“You place your faith in me? But you cannot do that
unless you love me. And if you love me—have I been
too headlong? Have I startled you? But surely you
must have seen that on the very first day we met, before
I had been an hour in your presence, my life was yours.
I tell you that I knew it—not an hour—one glance was
enough to tell me that I was all yours, and that for me
no other one lived or would ever live in the world. What
have you to say? Do not you believe me? What did
you mean by that word ‘pride’? It does not seem to me
that it had any connection with you or me.”</p>

<p>“Do not ask me to explain anything just now,” she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
said. “You would not like to be asked to explain how
you came to—to—think of me—to feel in regard to me as
you have said you do—”</p>

<p>“Why should I shrink from it?” he asked. “But no
one who has seen you would put such a question to me.
I loved you because you were—<em>you</em>. Is not that enough?
It would be sufficient for anyone who knew you. I saw
you sitting there—so sweetly timid—a little flower that
is so startled to find itself awakened into life in the
spring, that it would fain ask the earth to hide it again.
I thought of you as that modest little flower—a violet
trying to obscure its own charm by the leaves that surround
it; but all in vain—in vain, for its presence has
given a subtle perfume to the air, and all who breathe of
its delicate sweetness take the spirit of the spring into
their souls and know that a violet is there, though hidden
from their view. That is how I saw you. I have always
loved the violet, and felt that shyness and sweetness were
ever one; and am I to be reproached if I have a longing
to pluck my violet and have her ever with me?”</p>

<p>“This is madness—the poetry of madness,” she cried,
and there was really a piteous note in her voice. “But if
I did not believe that you feel every word that you have
spoken, I would let you continue, and drink in the sweetness
of every word that falls from your lips. It is because
I know that you are speaking from your heart and
because I also know my own unworthiness that I pray of
you to say no more—yet.”</p>

<p>“Why should I not tell you the truth, if you confess
that you believe I am speaking sincerely?”</p>

<p>“Sincerely, but in a dream.”</p>

<p>“Is all love a dream, then?—is that what is in your
thought?”</p>

<p>“I do not want it to be a dream. I wish the love to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
continue with your eyes open, and therefore I say—not
yet.”</p>

<p>“You wish my love to continue? Oh, never doubt
that your wish shall be granted. But why that ‘not yet’?
I am weary of this mystery.”</p>

<p>She was perplexed. Why should she hold out any
longer against this impetuous Prince of the land of King
Cophetua? Why should she not be as other girls who
allow themselves to be lifted out of insignificance by the
man who loves them. Why should that gift of being
able to see more closely into the truth of things that most
others accept without a question, be laid upon her as a
burden?</p>

<p>She had a strong impulse to let her resolution go down
the wind, and to put her hand in his, no matter who
might be looking on, and say the word to him that would
give him happiness. Who was she to suggest that his
happiness would not endure—that her happiness would
not endure?</p>

<p>She was perplexed. She had more than once been
called prim; but that only meant that it was her nature
to weigh everything in a mental balance, as it were, and
her imagination was equal (she thought) to the task of
assigning their relative value to the many constituents
of human happiness. If she had been told that this
meant that she had not yet been in love, and that she was
not now in love, she would not have felt uneasy in her
mind. She did not mistrust the feeling she had for the
man who was beside her. Surely this was the very spirit
of truth in loving, to be ready to sacrifice everything, so
that unhappiness should not overtake him; and she had
long ago felt that unhappiness only could result from his
linking his life with one who was rather less than a mere
nobody. The thought never once left her mind of what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
would be said when it was known that she had married
him. A dunce’s triumph, the incident would be styled
by the wits, and (assuming that the wits were masculine)
how would it be styled by the opposite sex? She could
see uplifted hands—incredulous eyebrows raised, while
they discussed it, and she knew that the conclusion that
everyone would come to was that to be the most divine
singer in the world did not save a man from being the
greatest fool in the world.</p>

<p>Was her love the less true because her intelligence insisted
on her perceiving that such a man as Signor Rauzzini
would not be happy if married to a nonentity like
herself? “Surely not,” she would have cried. “Surely
it is only the truest of all loves that would be ready to
relinquish its object rather than bring unhappiness upon
him! Is intelligence never to be found in association
with true love? Must true love and folly ever be regarded
as allies?”</p>

<p>Her intellect was quick in apprehending the strength
of the position taken up by two combatants in an argument;
but the juxtaposition of the Prim and the Passionate
was too much for her. She was all intellect; he was
all passion. Her mental outlook on the situation was
acute; but his was non-existent. His passion blinded
him; her intellect had a thousand eyes.</p>

<p>And there he was by her side; she could almost hear
the strong beating of his heart in the pause that followed
his question.</p>

<p>“What is this mystery?”</p>

<p>It was her feeling of this tumultuous beating of his
heart that all but made her lose her intellectual foothold.
His heart beating close to hers swayed her as the moon
sways the tides, until for some moments she could not
have told whether it was her heart or his that was beating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
so wildly—only for some moments, however; only long
enough for that madness to suggest itself to her—to let
her resolution fly to the winds—what did anything matter
so long as she could lay her hand in his, and feel his
fingers warm over hers? It was her first acquaintance
with the tyranny of a heart aflame, and for a moment
she bent her head before it. He thought that he had got
the better of her scruples, whatever they were, by the
way her voice broke as she said:</p>

<p>“Madness—it would be madness!”</p>

<p>He was not acute enough to perceive that she was talking
to herself—trying to bring her reason to help her to
hold out against the throbbing of her heart—<em>his</em> heart.</p>

<p>“It would indeed be madness for us to turn our backs
upon happiness when it is within our reach,” said he.
“That is what you would say, sweet saint?”</p>

<p>But she had now recovered herself.</p>

<p>“Indeed it is because I have no thought except for
your happiness that I entreat of you to listen to me,”
said Fanny.</p>

<p>“I will listen to you if you tell me in one word that
you love me,” said he.</p>

<p>There was no pause before she turned her eyes upon
him saying:</p>

<p>“You know it. You have never doubted it. It is because
I love you so truly I wish to save you from unhappiness.
I want to hold your love for ever and ever.”</p>

<p>“My sweet saint! You have heard my prayers. You
are to make me happy.”</p>

<p>“All that I can promise as yet is to save you from
supreme unhappiness. I am strong enough to do so, I
think.”</p>

<p>“You can save me from every unhappiness if you will
come to me—and you are coming, I know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>“I hope that if you ask me three months hence I shall
be able to say ‘yes’; but now—at this moment—I dare
not. It is not so long to ask you to wait, seeing that I
have let you have a glimpse of my heart, and told you
that as you feel for me, so I feel for you.”</p>

<p>“Three months is an eternity! Why should it be in
three months? Why not now?”</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>“I cannot tell you. It is my little secret,” she said.
“Ah, is it not enough that I have told you I love you?
I shall never cease to love you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, this accursed place! These accursed people!”
he murmured. “Why are we fated to meet only surrounded
by these wretches? Why cannot we meet where
I can have you in my arms, and kiss your lips that were
made for kissing?”</p>

<p>There was something terrifying to her in that low
whisper of his. He had put his head down to her until
his lips were close to her ear. She felt the warmth of
his face; it made her own burn. But she could not move
her face away to the extent of an inch. Her feminine
instinct of flight was succeeded by the equally feminine
instinct of surrender. If it had been his intention—and
it certainly seemed that it was—to kiss her in the presence
of all the company, she would still have been incapable
of avoiding such a caress.</p>

<p>He swore again in her ear, and Fanny, for all her
primness, felt a regret deep down in her heart that her
training would not allow of her expressing herself
through the same medium.</p>

<p>But he did not come any nearer to her than that. He
changed his phrases of abuse of their entourage to words
of delight at her presence so close to him—alternately
passionate and tender. His voice became a song in her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
ears, containing all such variations. His vocalism was
equal to the demand put upon it. It was his <i lang="fr">métier</i> to
interpret such emotions, and now he did justice to his
training, even if he fell short—and he was conscious of
doing so—of dealing adequately with his own feelings.
He called her once again his sweet saint who had heard
his prayer; his cherished flower, whose fragrance was
more grateful to him than all the incense burned in all
the temples of the world was to the Powers above. It
was, he repeated, her violet modesty that had first made
him adore her. Her humility brought before his eyes
the picture painted by Guido Reni—the Madonna saying:
<i lang="la">Ecce ancilla Domini</i>. Ah, her humility was divine.
And she was so like his mother—his dear mother who had
died when he was a boy and who had taught him to
sing. Ah, she was herself now singing in Paradise, and
she would look down and approve his choice. She, too,
had been as meek as a flower, and had never been so
happy as when they had been together at a little farm in
Tuscany with him by her side among the olives. Oh,
she would approve his choice. And quite simply he addressed
his dead mother, as though she were beside him,
asking her if she could desire to have a daughter sweeter
or more gentle. He had lapsed into his native Italian
in this; but Fanny could follow his slow, devout words,
and her eyes were full of tears, her heart of love.</p>

<p>She now perceived how simple and gentle a nature was
that of the young Roman. He remained unspoilt by the
adulation which he had received both in his own country
and in England. Seeing him thus revealing a simplicity
which she had not associated with him before, she was led
to ask herself if there was, after all, so great a difference
between them as she had believed to exist. She had forgotten
all about his singing, and he was now in her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
eyes nothing more than a man—the man who loved her.
Ah, that was enough. He loved her, and therefore she
was bound to save him from the mortification of hearing
the whispers of the people around them asking how he
could ever have been stupid enough to marry a girl like
herself, who was a nobody and without a fortune, when
he might have chosen any girl in the world.</p>

<p>Her resolution came back to her with greater force than
ever. Since he had made his nature plain to her, it
would, she felt, be taking advantage of his simplicity to
engage herself to him just as she was. She knew more
of the world than he did. She knew how the world
talked, and how it would talk regarding herself as well
as regarding him in such a matter. He was simple and
generous; it was necessary for her to take thought for
both of them.</p>

<p>“Have you heard me?” he asked of her in a whisper.</p>

<p>“The tears are still in my eyes,” she replied. “Oh,
my dear friend, cannot you see how bitter it is for me to
be compelled to ask you to wait for these months that I
spoke of? Cannot you see that it is a matter of conscience
and honour? Ah, I should never forgive myself
if I were to do other than I have done! If you—”</p>

<p>“Dear one,” said he, “I ask for nothing more than to
hear you tell me that you love me. Who am I, that I
should demand your secret? So long as you do not
conceal your love from me, I do not mind if you have a
score of secrets locked away in your white bosom. Tell
me again that you love me and all must be well.”</p>

<p>She looked at him, but he knew that she could not see a
feature of his face by reason of the tears that were still
in her eyes.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<p>It was on one of the last mornings in January that
Mrs. Burney was reading out of the newly-arrived
<cite>London Chronicle</cite> such paragraphs as she thought would
appeal to the varied interests of the breakfast-table.
There were a few announcements of marriages about to
take place between people whose names they knew, the
amount of the bride’s dowry being stated in each in plain
figures, though Mrs. Burney took it upon her to affirm
in one or two cases that the sum was exaggerated, or to
suggest that if the father of the bride were just enough
to pay his debts first, the portion of his daughter would
be considerably reduced. In the case of one of the gentlemen,
who was marrying thirty thousand pounds, she
ventured to express the hope that he would now pay at
least some of his creditors.</p>

<p>These were, of course, the most interesting items of
news, though their attractiveness was not greatly superior
to that of the gossip respecting Mr. F——, who had been
noticed in high dudgeon because of Lady P——’s dancing
three times with Sir Julian Y——; or that which suggested
that a reconcilement must have taken place between
the beautiful Mrs. G—— and her husband, for
they had been seen taking the air together in the Park.</p>

<p>It was also pleasant to learn that His Majesty had given
great encouragement to Mrs. Delany in the production of
her ingenious mosaic flowers, in which she was so skilled
as to excite the wonder of several critics in the Royal
circle; and also that His Royal Highness the Prince of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
Wales had been graciously pleased to say in public that
he had always admired the Perdita of the beautiful Mrs.
Robinson, though he considered Mrs. Abington, on the
whole, the most tasteful dresser in the Drury Lane company.</p>

<p>It was only when Mrs. Burney had folded the newspaper
and was about to put it away, that a few lines of
an advertisement caught her eye—she commented before
she read, as though she had been a fully qualified critic:</p>

<p>“More novels! More stuff for the circulating libraries!
Enough to make poor Mr. Richardson feel uncomfortable
in his grave! Could he but have known that
he was turning all England into novel readers he would
never have put pen to paper. Here is another imitator
in the field. ‘Evelina; or, a Young Lady’s Entrance into
the World,’ published to-day by Mr. Lowndes—three
volumes, seven and sixpence sewed, nine shillings in
covers. ‘Evelina,’ a distant cousin to ‘Clarissa’ and
‘Pamela’ I doubt not. I hope your father will not bring
anyone here to dinner to-day. Hashed mutton is a
wholesome dish, to be sure, but some visitors are fastidious.
He may bring as many as he pleases to-morrow,
for Mr. Greville’s gift of pheasants will be on the table.
Why are you staring so at your sister, Lottie?”</p>

<p>Lottie was becoming a hardened dissembler: she
scarcely started when asked to interpret certain furtive
glances she cast at Fanny.</p>

<p>“I was wondering if Fanny would make a face; she
never was fond of hashed mutton,” said Lottie glibly.
“If she had gone to school in France she would soon have
got a liking for it, cooked as it is there.”</p>

<p>“I am not partial to French kickshaws,” said Mrs.
Burney. “There’s nothing like good English fare. To
my thinking, the principle of making food tasty when in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
ordinary circumstances it should not be so, is a bad one.
Hash of mutton is wholesome food, and it should be eaten
as such without further question. If Providence had
meant it to be tasty as well, He would have made His
intentions as plain as in the case of roast pheasant.”</p>

<p>“Lottie will tell you that I made no face at the mention
of hash of mutton,” said Fanny. “What does it signify
whether one sits down to a simple platter of mutton hash
or a great dinner such as father gets at Mr. Thrale’s? A
pair of geese, a leg of mutton, a tongue, a rib of roast
beef and a brace of pheasants, with two or three dishes
of fish, and for Dr. Johnson a veal pie or a piece of pork—those
were on the table at one time. What is the
benefit of such abundance, when all that one can eat is
a single slice of beef?”</p>

<p>She spoke rapidly, for she, too, had been a great dissembler.
She meant to take away her stepmother’s attention
from those questionable glances which she had
exchanged with Lottie; and she succeeded very well.</p>

<p>“It would make no difference to us whether we had
one dish or ten; but it makes all the difference in the
world to Mr. Thrale. They say he has a prodigious appetite,
and eats of at least six heavy dishes of meat at
dinner.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Baretti affirms that some day he will not awake
from the stupor into which he falls after one of his heavy
meals,” said Susy.</p>

<p>“And all the time Mrs. Thrale is entreating him to be
more moderate,” cried Lottie.</p>

<p>“A humiliating duty for such as Mrs. Thrale,” said
her mother. “That shows how true is all that Fanny
has remarked: a simple dish should be enough for any
reasonable person. I have often wondered how the converse
at the Streatham table could be so wise and witty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
if the master of the house eats like a hog, and Dr. Johnson,
suffering from ill-health, expends so much energy
over his pork that the veins stand out on his forehead
and his face is bathed in perspiration.”</p>

<p>“I am sure that Mrs. Thrale has wit and liveliness
enough to serve for the whole company,” said Fanny.</p>

<p>“She is chatty enough, I doubt not,” replied Mrs. Burney.
“There are those who think she talks over-much
for a woman.”</p>

<p>“Not for a woman of fashion,” suggested Lottie with
some pertness, when their stepmother had left the room.
“It is long since Mrs. Thrale has invited mother to one
of the Streatham dinners,” she added under her breath.</p>

<p>And then the three fell upon the <cite>Chronicle</cite> for the announcement
of the book.</p>

<p>They read it in whispers, each following the other, as
though it were the <i lang="it">piano</i> part of a catch or a glee, and
glancing fearfully toward the door now and again, lest
it should open and Mrs. Burney reappear.</p>

<p>“How amazing it is!” said Susy. “This is the announcement
of the birth of a baby—and such a baby!”</p>

<p>“The birth and the christening and all,” said Lottie.
“Oh, Fanny, I had no idea that it would be in the papers—I
forgot that it would be advertised; and when mamma
read this out I thought I should sink through the floor.
So did you, I know.”</p>

<p>“I only wish that it had been possible,” said Fanny.
“I could feel myself getting hot all over my body. And
then you gave me that look, Lottie!”</p>

<p>“Could I help it?” asked Lottie. “You cannot blame
me. I really thought that it was you who gave me a look,
as much as to say: ‘If you let the cat out of the bag I
will never forgive you—no, never!’”</p>

<p>“Never mind! Among us we managed to get out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
the difficulty very well, I think. Were we not clever,
guiding the conversation away from Mr. Lowndes’s shop
on to the high road to Streatham?” cried Susy.</p>

<p>“’Twas the hash that saved us,” said Lottie. “Have
you not heard dear Jim applying the sailors’ expression,
to make a hash of something? But we didn’t make a
hash of our matter, did we, Fanny?” said Susan.</p>

<p>“We have become adroit dissemblers, and I am growing
more ashamed of it every day,” cried Fanny. “I
have reached the condition of a man of whom I read in a
volume of history: he had committed a crime, and the
effort that it cost him to keep it hidden so preyed upon
his mind that he could stand the strain no longer, so he
confessed it and was relieved.”</p>

<p>“But he could not have been really happy until they
hanged him,” said Susy. “And do you intend to confess
and be hanged, Fanny? Please do not. I think it is
the most exciting thing in the world to share a secret like
this. I would not have missed the enjoyment for anything.
Think, Fan, if you were to confess, you would
draw us into it too—you would make us out to be as
guilty as yourself.”</p>

<p>“I will not confess,” said Fanny. “No; it would not
be honourable of me. But I do feel that the secret is
having a bad effect upon us all. It has made us all such—such—dissemblers.”</p>

<p>“Psha!” said Lottie with a sniff. “That’s only another
way of saying that we are ladies of quality at an
early age.”</p>

<p>Fanny shook her head. She thought that if any proof
were needed of the ill effects of their treasuring their
secret from their parents, this cynical pertness of Lottie
supplied it. She shook her head.</p>

<p>“I should like ‘Evelina’ to come into mamma’s hands,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
continued Lottie. “She will go through the three volumes
at a hand gallop, even though she did take it upon
her to condemn it as being on a level with the odious
stuff that comes to us nowadays.”</p>

<p>“And if she condemns it so heartily before she has read
it, what will she say about it when she has finished the
last chapter?” asked Fanny.</p>

<p>“She will say that it is the prettiest story that has been
written since her dear Mr. Richardson died,” said
Susy.</p>

<p>“I doubt it, my dear,” said Fanny.</p>

<p>“Well, let the worst come, she will never guess that
you wrote it,” laughed Lottie.</p>

<p>“It is the padre whom I fear,” said Fanny. “Surely
he will not need to go beyond the Ode on the first leaf
to know that it is he himself whom I address.”</p>

<p>“And if he should—smoke it?” asked Susy, lapsing
into slang which she had acquired from her sailor brother,
who was in no sense a purist.</p>

<p>“If he should—well, either of two things will happen,”
replied the authoress. “He will either think me the
most double-dealing wretch in the world or the most dutiful
of daughters.”</p>

<p>“And which will be right?” asked Lottie.</p>

<p>“Both views will be right,” said Fanny. “Although
I meant every word of the Ode, I really think now that
the idea of writing it before the dedication came to me
only when I felt that I had behaved badly in sending the
book to the printer without his consent.”</p>

<p>“You wished the Ode to be a sort of peace-offering?”
said Susy. “You hoped that when he read it he would
forget to be angry? Well, that was cunning of you,
Fanny!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>“I tell you that the whole affair has had a bad effect
upon us all,” said Fanny gently.</p>

<p>Once again she was conscious of someone telling her
that there was no use crying over spilt milk, and this
impression was followed by one that took the form of a
resolution to be more careful in future. If she had
spilt some milk once, that was no reason why she should
not, by exercising proper forethought, refrain from doing
so again.</p>

<p>But the book was now given to the world, if the world
would have it, but as yet a copy had not come into her
hand. She wondered if she would have to spend seven
and sixpence in buying a copy. Seven shillings and sixpence,
sewed. It was a great deal of money. Was it
possible that there were five hundred people in the world
ready to pay seven and sixpence for a novel with the
name of no author on the title page? (She thought it
best to leave out of her consideration altogether the possible
purchasers of the nine shilling set of bound
volumes.)</p>

<p>Who were the people that ever laid out so much money
upon books which could be read through between the
rising and the setting of the sun? She had never met
such liberal enthusiasts. Of course, it was only reasonable
that so splendid a work as the “History of Music”
should be in the library of every house wherein people of
taste resided, but that was not a book to be galloped
through; some people might not be able to read it within
a month. Besides, it bore the honoured name of Dr. Burney
on the title page, and the fame of Dr. Burney was
great. But as for that poor little seven-and-sixpenny
sewed “Evelina,” how should anyone take an interest in
her without reading her story? How would anyone read<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
her story without feeling afterwards that seven-and-sixpence
(leaving the nine shilling expenditure out of the
question) was a ridiculous price to pay for such an entertainment?</p>

<p>She felt that people would come to look on her as the
instigator of a fraud if they paid their money and read
the book and then found out that she had written it. The
wisdom of concealing her name even from the bookseller
was now more apparent to her than it had ever been.
She had visions of indignant purchasers railing against
Mr. Lowndes, and Mr. Lowndes searching for her, so that
he might rail against her; and so her speculations ended
in laughter; but even her laughter grated upon her sensitive
ears: she felt that it was the malicious jeering of a
clever cheat at the thought of having got the better of a
worthy man.</p>

<p>Her precious “Evelina” was leading her a pretty
dance. If it had not been able to do so it would have
been a paltry sort of book and she would have been a
paltry sort of author.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<p>Two or three weeks passed without her hearing anything
of the book, and it seemed as if it had fallen,
as she had at some moments hoped it would fall, like a
dull stone into the depths of the sea. She heard nothing
of it, and soon she perceived that her sisters felt grievously
disappointed at its failure to produce any impression
upon the town. Even a dull stone, if dropped into
the deep, creates a little fuss on the surface before it
sinks out of sight; but Fanny’s book did not, so far as
they could see, produce even so superficial an impression.
What they expected of it they might have had
some trouble explaining; but as it was, they could not
conceal their disappointment from Fanny; and they
showed it after a short time in a very delicate way: they
never alluded to the book in her presence. She perceived
that what was in their minds was that it would show very
bad taste on their part to refer to it in any way. She
was grateful for their consideration; and she resolved to
accept their decision on this point as final; she would
never allude to the horrid thing in their hearing.</p>

<p>It so happened, however, that she was left alone with
Susy in the house one evening. Dr. Burney and his wife
had gone to a concert at Esther’s, and Lottie was staying
for a day or two in the country. Susy was practising
her part of a new duet on the piano, and Fanny was at
her sewing. So far as conversation between the two
sisters was concerned, the evening had been a very silent
one. Indeed, during the whole week a constrained silence
had marked the intercourse of the three girls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>Susy hammered away at the music for half an hour;
then her playing became more fitful, and at last it ceased
altogether.</p>

<p>There was a long silence before Fanny heard a little
sound that caused her to raise her head. It was the
sound of a sob, and when she looked up she saw that Susy
was leaning her forehead upon the bottom of the music
rest, weeping bitterly.</p>

<p>Fanny was by her side in a moment.</p>

<p>“Dearest Susy, what is the matter?” she said soothingly.
“Tell me, dear; has anything happened? Has
anyone been unkind to you? Have I unwittingly done
or said anything that seemed to you unkind? Tell me
all, Susy.”</p>

<p>But Susy continued crying with her face hidden,
though she yielded one of her hands to Fanny.</p>

<p>“Come, my dear, I have helped you before now, and I
may be able to help you now. Prithee, what is your
trouble?” said Fanny, putting her arm round the girl’s
shoulders.</p>

<p>Still Susy remained silent, except for her sobs.</p>

<p>“Tell me,” said Fanny, in a whisper. “Is it that you
think that I am chagrined about—about—the book?”</p>

<p>In an instant Susy had whirled round on her seat and
flung her arms round her sister’s neck, laying her head
on her shoulder.</p>

<p>“Oh, Fanny, Fanny, ’tis too cruel!” she sobbed. “We
were sure that so much would come of it—it seemed so
splendid to read, even before it was printed—so much
better than any other story that ever came into our
hands—and you worked so hard at it—every spare
moment when you might have been enjoying yourself—in
the cold of last winter up in that room—and at Lynn
too—and Chessington—and now, when we think that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
your cleverness, your patience, your genius, is to be
rewarded, nothing comes of it—all your trouble has
gone for nothing—all our secrecy! Oh, it is too cruel!”</p>

<p>“You dear child,” said Fanny. “It is only cruel if
it sets you crying in this way. What does it matter
to anyone if the book has gone and nothing has come
of it? I have been thinking that writing a book and
publishing it is like throwing a stone into the sea. It
may fall so that it sinks down plumb, or it may fall so
that it makes a splash for a while, but it sinks to the
bottom all the same. Success or failure is only the difference
between a splash and a ripple. We were fools to
fancy that our little stone would float.”</p>

<p>“But it was not a stone, it was full of life and it
should have—it should have—swum! Oh, the people
who buy books are so stupid!”</p>

<p>“They are—that was the hope that I builded on.
They are stupid, but not stupid enough to buy my book.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Fanny!”</p>

<p>“That is really the frame of mind that I find myself
in to-day. I tell you truly, Susy, that after the first
week, I schooled myself to think of the business in this
way; and I am certain that in another month I shall
even feel delighted that my little pebble made no splash.
Look at the matter philosophically, Susy.”</p>

<p>“Oh, philosophically!”</p>

<p>“Well, reasonably. Are we in a different position
to-day from that we were in before the book was published?
We are not. We are just the same as we were
before. It has not injured us in any way. Nay, if you
think of it, we are—I, at least, am—all the better for
having failed, for I have learned my lesson. I was beginning
to feel cleverer than I had any right to think
myself, and this has come as a chastening—to make me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
know my right place. These rebukes do not come by
chance, Susy. I know now that I was inclined to hold
my head too high. I don’t think that I will do so
again.”</p>

<p>“You never held your head too high—just the opposite.
And I think it very cruel that you should be rebuked
for nothing. But I do not blame anyone except the
wretched people who refused to buy your nice book, but
spent their seven and sixpence at Vauxhall or
Ranelagh—perhaps watching Mr. Foote and his puppets
at the Haymarket. Oh, I have no patience with them!
Why, it only needed a thousand people to buy the book
and it would have been accounted a success!”</p>

<p>“Then we shall put the blame on the shoulders of
that thousand, wheresoever they may be found, and for
my part I shall not hold a second thousand altogether
blameless—my indignation may even extend to a third.
Now, that’s the last word I mean to speak about the
book. It has by this time reached the bottom of the
sea on which I threw it; and there let it lie!”</p>

<p>“You are an angel—I see that plainly now.”</p>

<p>“Ah, there you see, what I said was true: I am much
better for the rebuke I talked about; you never perceived
before that I was an angel. Now let that be the
last word between us on the subject of my poor little
‘Evelina.’ Her entrance into the world has proved
fatal. Oh, Susy, she was stillborn, but her parent is
making a rapid recovery.”</p>

<p>“That may be; but cannot you join with me in—”</p>

<p>“I will join with you in maintaining silence on the
subject of the little one. I cannot bear to hear her
name mentioned. I refuse to say another word about
her or her fate. She must have been greatly beloved of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
the gods to die so young. Let that be ‘Evelina’s’ epitaph.
I will say nothing more about her.”</p>

<p>It so happened, however, that she was compelled to
say a good deal more on the subject, for within half an
hour Cousin Edward had called, and he began to talk
of “Evelina” at once.</p>

<p>“I went to Hill’s library in the Strand yesterday, to
get a book for mother, and there, sure enough, I saw
your ‘Evelina,’” said he. “I asked the man in charge
what it was about, and he replied that he didn’t know;
it was bad enough, he thought, to be compelled to hand
out books all day to readers without being forced to
read them for himself; but he supposed that ‘Evelina’
was a novel of the usual sort.”</p>

<p>“That was not extravagant praise,” remarked Susy.</p>

<p>“He didn’t mean to praise it,” said Edward. “But
when I asked him if anyone who had read it had recommended
it, he admitted that every one of the five ladies
who had read it was ready to speak well of it—one of
them had taken it away a second time; and—would you
believe it?—while I was standing at the counter a footman
entered the shop with a demand for ‘Evelina,’
as he called it; and he carried off the copy that was already
on the desk.”</p>

<p>“For the delectation of the servants’ hall?” suggested
Fanny.</p>

<p>“Not at all—it had been recommended to her ladyship,
he said, and he had been commanded on no account
to return without it; her ladyship was liberal; she would
not mind paying sixpence for it, instead of the ordinary
fourpence.”</p>

<p>“That was more than liberal, it was generous to a
degree,” said Fanny.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>“Don’t interrupt him,” cried Susy. “Continue your
narrative, Eddy. I am dying to hear the rest.”</p>

<p>“I asked the library man if he knew who wrote the
book, and he replied that he had heard the name, but
had forgotten it; so far as he remembered the author
was a peer of high rank but eccentric habits,” said
Edward.</p>

<p>“The book represented his eccentric habits, I suppose,”
remarked Fanny.</p>

<p>“I ran out of the place roaring,” said Edward.
“‘A peer of high rank but eccentric habits’—describes
you to a T, doesn’t it, Cousin Fanny? Pray what is
your lordship’s next work to be, and when will it be
given to an eager world?”</p>

<p>“Is that all you have to tell?” asked Susy.</p>

<p>“By no means. When I heard that the book was
thought well of in the Strand, I thought I would try
to get at the opinion of Stanhope Street—you know
Masterman’s circulating library there? Well, I boldly
entered, and there, sure enough, was a well-thumbed
‘Evelina’ in front of the librarian. I asked for some
book that no one had ever heard of, and when the
librarian had told me that he had never been asked
for that book before, I pointed to ‘Evelina,’ inquiring
if it was any good. ‘I’m dead tired on account of its
goodness, for I was fool enough to take it to bed with
me last night, and I never closed my eyes in sleep,’ he
replied. ‘I had it praised to me by a lady of quality,
and so too hastily concluded that it would either send
me asleep with its dullness, or shock me with its ribaldry;
but it did neither, unhappily.’ Just then a chariot
stopped at the door and another footman entered with
the name ‘Evelina’ written on a sheet of paper, and off
he popped with the full three volumes under his arm.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
I waited no longer; but hurried hither to give you my
news. I did not get so far, however, for I was unlucky
enough to be overtaken by that vile downpour of rain,
and it did not blow over until your dinner hour was at
hand.”</p>

<p>“You are my good angel!” cried Fanny, her cheeks
glowing. “We have heard nothing of all this respecting
the book, and, hearing nothing, we took it for granted
that it was dead—dead before it was ever alive. Oh,
this is good news you have brought us, Eddy!”</p>

<p>“The best news that has come to us for months!”
said Susy. She had turned her head away and was
furtively wiping her eyes. The good news affected the
sympathetic Susy almost as deeply as her disappointment
had done.</p>

<p>“But I have only told you of my adventures of yesterday,”
said Edward. “To-day I tried the booksellers,
beginning with Mr. Davies and working round to the
Dillys in the Poultry—it cost me three shillings, for
I had to buy something that I did not particularly want
in every shop to excuse my inquiries—and I found
‘Evelina’ on every counter. I cannot say that any
customer came in to buy it while I was in any shop, but
you may be sure that the book would not be on the
counter unless it was highly thought of. Of course I
had need to be very discreet among the booksellers; I
dared not ask who was the author, but I longed to do
so, if only to hear what new story had been made up
about it.”</p>

<p>“You heard quite enough to make us glad,” cried
Susy. “Oh, how foolish we were to take it for granted
that because we had no news of the book, it was dead!
It is alive—greatly alive, it would appear! How could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
any news of it have come to us here? We should have
gone forth in search of it.”</p>

<p>“I knew that we could depend on your discretion,”
said Fanny, laying a hand on each of his shoulders. “I
do not think that I ever thanked you as I should for the
wise way in which you managed the business with Mr.
Lowndes, and now I must not neglect to do so for having
acted the part of a benevolent agent in bringing us
such good news about the book.”</p>

<p>“Psha! there should be no talk of gratitude and the
like between us,” said he. “There are family ties—I
think of the honour of our family. People already
talk of the clever Burneys, but they left you out of the
question, Cousin Fanny, since they only thought of
music. But now that you have shown what you can
do in another direction, you must be reckoned with
alongside the others.”</p>

<p>“And what about the other branch of the clever
Burneys?” said Fanny. “Don’t you think that people
will some of these days begin to ask if Edward Burney,
the great painter, is really a brother of the musical
Burneys? I hope they will, dear Edward; I hope that
the fame of Edward Burney, the painter, will go far
beyond that of the musical Burneys, as well as poor
Fanny Burney, who once wrote a novel.”</p>

<p>The young man blushed as Fanny herself would certainly
have done if confronted with the least little compliment.
But there was no false shame about his acceptance
of her suggestion.</p>

<p>“I mean to become as good a painter as I can, in order
to be worthy of the name of Burney,” said he. “I
feel proud of being a Burney—more so to-day than ever
before, and I hope that the rest of the Burneys will
some day look on me as doing credit to our name.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>“I am sure that they will have every reason to do
so,” said Fanny.</p>

<p>When he had gone, Susy gave way to her delight at
the news which he had brought. She was a good deal
taller than Fanny, and catching her round the waist
after the manner of the Elizabethan dancer with his
partner, she danced round the table with her, lilting a
somewhat breathless pæan. Fanny herself needed no
coaxing to be her partner in this revel. In her jubilant
moments she got rid of the primness which most people
associated with her. She had a wild jig known as
“Nancy Dawson,” and she had more than once found
it necessary to get rid of her superfluous spirits through
this medium. She joined in her sister’s little whoop at
the completion of the third “lap” of the table, and they
both threw themselves breathless on the sofa.</p>

<p>“I knew it,” said Susy between her gasps. “I knew
that I could not be mistaken in believing ‘Evelina’ to
be good—I knew that she would make her way in the
affections of her readers, and I was right—you see I was
right.”</p>

<p>“You were right, dear Susy—quite right,” said
Fanny. “I do not like to be too sanguine, but I do
believe, from the reports Eddy brought us, that the book
will find plenty of readers. Now that we can think over
the matter in a reasonable way, we must see how foolish
we were to expect that the very day after the book was
published people would crowd to buy it; but now, after
six weeks, when Eddy goes in search of news about it,
he brings back a report which is—we had best say for
the present no more than ‘quite satisfactory’—that was
the bookseller’s report about the sales of the first volume
of the padre’s ‘History’—‘quite satisfactory’—that
should be quite satisfactory for the author of ‘Evelina’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
and her sisters. There is nothing in the book to stir
people as it would if written by Mr. Wilkes, but in its
humble way it will, I am now persuaded, be pronounced
‘quite satisfactory.’ At any rate, there goes my sewing
for the evening.”</p>

<p>She rolled up the strip of linen into a ball and used
her hand, after two false starts, as a battledore, to send
it flying across the room within reach of Susy, who, being
more adroit, was able at the first attempt to return
it with both force and precision. Once more Fanny
struck it, and her sister sent it back, but by this time
the unequal ball had opened out, so that it was only
by her foot that Fanny could deal with it effectively.
Then, daintily holding up their petticoats, the author of
‘Evelina’ and Susy Burney played with the thing until
once more they were panting and laughing joyously.</p>

<p>Perhaps Fanny had a faint inkling of the symbolism
implied by this treatment of the discarded needlework.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<p>But little Miss Burney had recovered all her primness
on the evening when, a week later, she accompanied
her stepmother to partake of tea at the home of
the Barlowes in the Poultry.</p>

<p>Young Mr. Barlowe had, for some time after his visit
to St. Martin’s Street, brooded over his indiscretion in
allowing his impulse at the moment of saying good night
to carry him away so that he pressed Miss Burney’s
hand, looking into her eyes with an expression in his
own of the deepest sympathy—rather more than sympathy.
He felt that he had been unduly and indiscreetly
hasty in his action. It had been purely impulsive.
He had by no means made up his mind that
Miss Burney would make him a satisfactory wife. His
father and mother had, for a long time, thought very
highly of Mrs. Burney, looking on her as a most thrifty
and excellent manager of a household. She had shown
herself to be all this and more when her first husband
was alive and they had visited her at Lynn; and she
had proved her capabilities in the same direction since
she had married Dr. Burney. Unfortunately, however,
the virtues of a stepmother could not be depended on
to descend to the children of her husband’s family, and
it was by no means certain that Miss Burney had made
full use of her opportunities of modelling herself upon
her father’s second wife.</p>

<p>No, he had not quite made up his mind on this subject—the
gravest that had ever occupied his attention,
and he remained sleepless for hours, fearful that he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
gone too far in that look and that squeeze. He had
heard of fathers and even brothers waiting upon
young men who had acted toward a daughter or a sister
pretty much as he had in regard to Miss Burney. He
had rather a dread of being visited by Miss Burney’s
brother, that young naval officer who had boasted of
having been educated by a murderer. Mr. Barlowe
thought that a visit from such a young man would be
most undesirable, and for several days he went about his
business with great uneasiness.</p>

<p>But when a week had gone by and neither father nor
brother had waited upon him, he began to review his
position more indulgently than when he had previously
given it his consideration. He thought more hopefully
of Miss Burney as a wife. Perhaps she might have
profited more largely than he had thought by her daily
intercourse with so capable a woman as Mrs. Burney.
At any rate, she was not musical, and that was something
in her favour. Then her stepmother had praised her
needlework, and everyone knows that to be a good sempstress
is next to being a good housekeeper.</p>

<p>He thought that on the whole she would do. Her
brother, Lieutenant Burney, would naturally spend most
of his time at sea. That was a good thing. Thomas felt
that he should hesitate to make any change in his life
that involved a liability of frequent visits from a young
man who had been taught by a murderer. Who could
tell what might happen in the case of such a young man?
As for Miss Burney herself, she was, quite apart from
her housewifely qualities, a most estimable young lady—modest
and retiring, as a young woman should be, and
very beautiful. To be sure, he had often heard that
beauty was only skin deep, but even assuming that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
did not go any deeper, it had always been highly
esteemed by men—none of them seemed to wish it to be
of any greater depth; and it was certain that a man
with a handsome wife was greatly envied—more
so even than a man who was married to a plain woman
but a good housewife. Oh, undoubtedly her beauty commended
her to his most indulgent consideration. He had
no objection in the world to be widely envied, if only
on account of his wife’s good looks. It never occurred
to him that it might be that some people would think
very ordinary a face that seemed to one who was in love
with it extremely lovely. He preserved the precious
privilege of a man to raise up his own standard of
beauty and expect all the rest of the world to acknowledge
its supremacy.</p>

<p>Yes, he thought that Miss Burney, beauty and all,
would suit him, but still he hesitated in making another
call.</p>

<p>This was when Mr. Kendal had the honour of waiting
upon Mrs. Burney, and his visit only preceded by a day
or two Mrs. Burney’s call upon her old friend, Mrs.
Barlowe, in the Poultry; this interchange of courtesies
being speedily followed by an invitation for Mrs. Burney
and a stepdaughter to drink tea with the Barlowe
family.</p>

<p>“I am taking you with me, Fanny, because you are
the eldest and, as should be, the most sensible of the
household,” said Mrs. Burney, explaining—so far as she
thought wise—the invitation on the morning it was
received. “There will be no music at Mrs. Barlowe’s,
I think, and so you will have no distracting influence
to prevent your forming a just opinion of my old
friends.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>“I do not mind in the least the absence of music for
one night,” said Fanny.</p>

<p>“I am sure of that,” said Mrs. Burney. “Goodness
knows we have music enough here during any day to
last us over a whole week. The others could not live
without it, even if it were not your father’s profession.”</p>

<p>“Without which none of us could live,” remarked
Fanny, who had no wish to be forced into the position
of the opponent of music in the household.</p>

<p>“Quite right, my dear,” acquiesced the elder lady.
“It is a precarious way of making a living. To my
mind there is nothing so satisfactory as a good commercial
business—a merchant with a shop at his back
can afford to laugh at all the world.”</p>

<p>“But he usually refrains,” said Fanny.</p>

<p>“True; he looks at life with proper seriousness, and
without levity. Great fortunes are the result of serious
attention to business. Levity leads to poverty.”</p>

<p>“Except in the case of Mr. Garrick and a few others.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Garrick is certainly an exception. But, then,
you must remember that he was a merchant before he
became an actor, and his business habits never left him.
I have heard it said that he got more out of his company
for the salaries he paid than any theatre manager in
Europe. But I did not come to you to talk about Mr.
Garrick. I only meant to say that I know you are an
observant girl. You do not merely glance at the surface
of things, so I am sure that you will perceive much to
respect in all the members of Mrs. Barlowe’s family.”</p>

<p>“I am sure they are eminently—respectable, mamma;
and I am glad that you have chosen me to be your
companion this evening. I like going among such
people—it is useful.”</p>

<p>She stopped short in a way that should have aroused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
the suspicions of Mrs. Burney, but that lady was unsuspecting,
she was only puzzled.</p>

<p>“Useful?” she said interrogatively.</p>

<p>Fanny had no mind to explain that she thought herself
rather good at describing people of the Barlowe
type, and was ready to submit herself to more experience
of them in case she might be encouraged to write another
novel. But she knew that she would have some difficulty
in explaining this to her stepmother, who herself was
an excellent type.</p>

<p>“Useful—perhaps I should rather have said ‘instructive,’”
she replied, after a little pause.</p>

<p>“Instructive, yes; I am glad that you look at our
visit so sensibly—I knew you would do so. Yes, you
should learn much of the excellence of these people
even in the short time that we shall be with them. And
it is well that you should remember, my dear Fanny,
that you are now quite old enough to have a house of
your own to look after.”</p>

<p>It was now Fanny’s turn to seem puzzled.</p>

<p>“I do not quite see how—I mean why—why—that is,
the connection—is there any connection between—?”</p>

<p>“What I mean to say is that if at some time a suitor
for your hand should appear, belonging to a respectable
mercantile family, you will know, without the need of
any telling, that your chances of happiness with such
a man are far greater than they would be were you
to wed someone whose means of getting a living were
solely the practice of some of the arts, as they are called—music
or painting or the rest.”</p>

<p>“I do not doubt that, mamma,” said Fanny demurely.
She was beginning to think that her stepmother was a
far better type than she had fancied.</p>

<p>And her stepmother was beginning to think that she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
had never given Fanny credit for all the good sense
she possessed.</p>

<p>The six o’clock tea-party in the Poultry was a function
that Fanny Burney’s quick pen only could describe
as it deserved to be described. All the time that it was
proceeding her fingers were itching to start on it. She
could see Mr. Crisp smiling in that appreciative way
that he had, as he read her smart sentences, every one
of them with its little acid flavour, that remained on
the palate of his memory. She was an artist in character
drawing, and she was one of the first to perceive
how excellent was the material for artistic treatment that
might be found in the house of the English tradesman—the
superior tradesman who aspired to be called a
merchant. She neglected no opportunity of observing
such houses; it was only when she was daily consorting
with people of the highest rank that she became alarmed
lest her descriptions should be accepted as proof that she
was in the habit of meeting on terms of intimacy the
types of English bourgeois which she had drawn.</p>

<p>The ground-floor of Mr. Barlowe’s house in the
Poultry was given over to his business, which, as has
already been mentioned, was that of a vendor of gold
and silver lace. The walls carried shelves from floor
to ceiling, and every shelf had its line of boxes enclosing
samples of an abundant and valuable stock. The large
room at the back was a sort of counting-house parlour,
where Mr. Barlowe sat during the day with his son and
an elderly clerk, ready for the customers, whose arrival
was announced by the ringing of a spring bell. The
scales for the weighing of the bullion and the worked
gold and silver wire were suspended above the broad
counter in the shop, and from a hook between the shelves
there hung a number of ruled forms with spaces for oz.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
dwt. and grs. On these were entered the particulars
of the material supplied to the workmen who made up
the lace as required. The upper part of the house was
the home of the family, the spacious dining-room being
in the front, its convex windows overhanging the busy
thoroughfare. Opening off this apartment was an
equally large drawing-room, and the furniture of both
was of walnut made in the reign of Queen Anne, with
an occasional piece of Dutch marqueterie of the heavier
character favoured by the craftsmen of the previous
sovereigns. The rooms themselves were panelled with
oak and lighted by candles in brass sconces.</p>

<p>It seemed to Fanny, on entering the dining-room, that
every seat was occupied. But she soon saw that there
were several vacant chairs. It was the imposing row of
figures confronting her that made the room seem full,
although only six persons were present besides young
Mr. Barlowe and his parents, who met Mrs. Burney and
her stepdaughter at the door. Fanny greeted Thomas
at once, and she could see that his eyes were beaming,
but with a rather more subdued light than shone in them
on that night when he had pressed her hand. She was
conscious, at the same time, of the approach of a big
elderly gentleman, wearing a well-ordered wig, evidently
newly curled, with a small lady clad in expensive and
expansive black silk by his side. He was holding the
tips of her fingers and they advanced in step as though
they were starting to dance a minuet.</p>

<p>They stood in front of her and her mother, while
Thomas, moving to one side, said, making a low bow:</p>

<p>“Miss Burney, I have the honour to present to you
my father, Mr. Barlowe, and my mother, Mrs. Barlowe.
Mrs. Burney, madam, you are, I know, already acquainted
with my parents.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>The little lady curtsied and her husband made a fine
shopkeeper’s bow, first to Fanny, then to Mrs. Burney.</p>

<p>The formality of the presentation was overwhelming
to poor Fanny. She could feel herself blushing, and she
certainly was more overcome than she had been when
Count Orloff, the Russian, visited the house in St.
Martin’s Street and she gazed with awe upon the thumb
that had, it was rumoured, pressed too rigidly the windpipe
of the unfortunate Peter. All that she could do
was to try to hide her confusion by the deepest of
curtsies.</p>

<p>“We are sensible of the honour you have done us,
madam,” said Mr. Barlowe when he had recovered himself—he
was addressing Fanny, ignoring for the moment
the presence of Mrs. Burney.</p>

<p>“Our son has spoken to us of you with great admiration,
Miss Burney,” said the little lady. “But I protest
that when I look at you I feel as King Solomon did when
he saw the Queen of Sheba, the half has not been told.”</p>

<p>“Oh, madam, you flatter me,” said Fanny, trying to
put some force into a voice that her shyness had rendered
scarcely audible.</p>

<p>Her stepmother, perceiving how she was suffering,
hastened to greet in a much less formal way their host
and hostess; but she had considerable difficulty in bringing
them down to her level. It seemed that they had
prepared some high phrases of welcome for their younger
visitor only, and they had no mind that they should be
wasted.</p>

<p>“My stepdaughter is of a retiring nature,” said Mrs.
Burney. “She is quite unused to such ceremony as you
honour her with. Well, Martha, how is the rheumatism?”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<p>Mrs. Barlowe did not seem half pleased to be
brought down so from the high parallels of etiquette
among which she had been soaring. But she had
lost her place, and before she could recover herself,
Fanny had slipped behind her stepmother.</p>

<p>“Ask me all about her rheumatism, madam, for ’tis
me that knows more about it than her,” said Mr. Barlowe,
with a jerk of his thumb and a wink in the direction
of his wife. The homely enquiry of Mrs. Burney
had clearly forced him to throw off all ceremony and
treat the visit of Miss Burney as an ordinary domestic
incident.</p>

<p>His wife would have none of this, however; she said
in tones of stiff reproof:</p>

<p>“Mr. Barlowe, you forget that the young lady has not
been presented to Brother Jonathan or the Alderman.
Thomas, it is for you to usher the lady into the presence
of your uncles and aunts. Pray be not remiss, Thomas.
There is no excuse for such an omission.”</p>

<p>“I was only waiting until you had finished, ma’am,”
said Thomas.</p>

<p>“I have finished,” she replied, with a stiff nod. “To
be sure, ’twas my intention to express, in what I trust
would be appropriate terms, our happiness in welcoming
Miss Burney to our humble home; a few phrases of
this sort were not thought out of place when I was
young; but it appears that your father knows better
what is <i lang="fr">comme il faut</i> and <i lang="fr">haut ton</i> than me. Bring the
young lady forward, Thomas.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>The younger Thomas looked dubiously from his mother
to his father. He was uncommonly like an actor who
had forgotten his part, Fanny thought—he had no
initiative. Fanny herself was more at home than any of
the household. While the young man hesitated, she
walked up the room as if she meant to present herself
to the six figures that sat in a row at the farther end.</p>

<p>Thomas was beside her in a moment.</p>

<p>“I ask your pardon, Miss Burney,” he said. “But
I knew that mamma had at least two more welcomes for
your ear, and I feared that she had forgot them. Do
not you think that mamma speaks well? Perhaps it
would be unjust to judge her by what she said—she
only made a beginning. You will be delighted when you
are going away.”</p>

<p>Fanny felt that this prediction was certain to be
realized.</p>

<p>“Yes, mamma’s good-byes are as well worded as her
greetings,” he continued; “a clergyman could scarcely
better them; and I hope—”</p>

<p>But now they were face to face with the six figures
sitting in a row, and as his conversation was only designed
as an accompaniment to the march of Fanny to
this position, there was no reason to continue it.</p>

<p>The figures were of two men and four ladies. The
former were middle-aged and bore an expression of
gravity that a judge might have envied. Their dress
was sombre, but of the finest material possible to buy,
and each of them was painfully conscious of being in
unusual garments. Of course, Fanny saw in a moment
that they were merchants wearing the garments in which
they attended church.</p>

<p>Of the four ladies, three were elderly and the fourth
much younger. They wore their hair built up in a way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
that suggested that they desired to follow the fashion
but had not the courage to complete the scheme with
which they had started. The long and thin and highly-coloured
feathers which crowned the stunted structures
on their heads gave them the appearance of a picture
of unfamiliar birds. Their dresses were extremely
glossy and of an expensive material, but there was an
eccentric note about all that made them seem not impressive
as they should have been, but almost ludicrous. The
youngest lady in the row showed unmistakable signs of
being given to simpering. She had gone much further
than the others of the party in the architecture of her
hair, but that was possibly because the material at her
command was more abundant. The dressing of her hair,
however, was by no means in sympathy with the style
of her garments, the latter being simple and indeed
rather too girlish for the wearer, who looked between
twenty-five and thirty.</p>

<p>It was an extraordinary ordeal that confronted Miss
Burney, for young Mr. Barlowe began presenting her
to the group, starting from his left and working slowly
to the last of the row on the right. There was she with
the young man standing close to her, but sideways, doing
the formalities of presenting her, while his father
and mother stood behind to see that he omitted nothing.
Mrs. Burney, a little way apart, was alternately smiling
and frowning at the ceremonial. She could see, from
observing the effect that the whole business was producing
upon Fanny, that the Barlowes were defeating
their own ends, assuming that they desired Fanny to
become a member of their family. These absurd formalities
were, Mrs. Burney knew, quite out of place in a
private house. But what could she do to cut them short?
She had made an attempt before, and it was received in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
anything but a friendly spirit by their hostess, so that
she did not feel inclined to interfere again: the thing
must run its course, she felt, reflecting upon it as though
it were a malady. There was no means of curtailing
it.</p>

<p>And its course was a slow one for the unhappy victim.</p>

<p>“Miss Burney, I have the honour to present my aunt
on my mother’s, side—Mrs. Alderman Kensit,” droned
Thomas, and the lady on the extreme left rose at the
mention of her name and made a carefully prepared
curtsey, while the sky-blue feather in her hair jerked
awkwardly forward until the end almost touched her
nose.</p>

<p>“Proud to meet Miss Burney, I vow,” said she as she
rose; and anyone could see from the expression on her
face that she was satisfied that she had gone far in proving
her claim to be looked on as a lady of fashion. She
had never said “I vow” before, and she knew that it
had startled her relations. She felt that she could
not help that. Miss Burney would understand that she
was face to face with someone who had mingled with the
best.</p>

<p>“And this is Aunt Maria, father’s sister, Mrs. Hutchings,”
came the voice of Thomas, and the second lady
bobbed up with quivering feathers and made a well-practised
curtsey. She did not trust herself to speak.
Having heard her neighbour’s “I vow,” she knew that
she could not go farther. She would not compete with
such an exponent of the mysteries of <i lang="fr">haut ton</i>.</p>

<p>“And this is Alderman Kensit of the Common Council;
he is my uncle on my mother’s side—mother is a
Kensit, you know,” resumed Thomas. “And this is
Aunt Jelicoe. My mother’s sister married Mr. Jelicoe,
of Tooley Street. And this is my cousin, Miss Jelicoe.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
I am sure that you will like Miss Jelicoe, Miss Burney,
she is so young.”</p>

<p>The youngest lady of the group simpered with great
shyness, concealing half her face with her fan and holding
her head to one side, and then pretending to be
terribly fluttered. Her curtsey was made in a flurry,
and with a little exclamation of “Oh, la!”</p>

<p>Another uncle only remained to be presented; he
turned out to be Mr. Jonathan Barlowe, and he was,
Thomas whispered half audibly to Fanny, in trade in
the Indies.</p>

<p>It was all over, curtsies and bows and exclamations—echoes
of the world of fashion and elsewhere—she had
been presented to every member of the row and they
had resumed their seats, while she hastened to the side
of her stepmother, hot and breathless. She had never
before been subjected to such an ordeal. She had gladly
agreed to accompany her stepmother to this house, for
she hoped thereby to increase her observation of a class
of people who repaid her study of them; but she had no
notion that she should have to vacate her place as an
Observer and take up that of a Participator. She was
to pay dearly for her experience.</p>

<p>She was burning, her stepmother could see; and she
believed that this was due to her mortification on noticing
that the dress of the ladies was infinitely more expensive
than hers. That would be enough to make any
young woman with ordinary susceptibilities indignant,
she felt; and she herself, having had an opportunity of
giving some attention to the expensive silks—she could
appraise their value to a penny—was conscious of some
chagrin on this account. She was almost out of patience
with her old friend, Martha Barlowe, for making all this
parade. The foolish woman had done so, she knew, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
order to impress Miss Burney and to give her to understand
that she was becoming associated with no ordinary
family. But Mrs. Burney had seen enough since she had
left Lynn for London to know that Fanny would not
be the least impressed except in the direction of boredom
by such an excess of ceremony in the house of a
tradesman. She had heard Fanny’s comment upon the
gorgeous chariot which Sir Joshua Reynolds had set up,
and she could not doubt what Fanny’s opinion would be
regarding this simple tea to which she had consented to
go at the Barlowes’ house.</p>

<p>Fanny had hurried to her side as soon as she had
passed the row of uncles and aunts. She thought that
the girl seemed overcome by the tedium of the formalities;
but in a few minutes she saw that Fanny was
on the verge of laughter.</p>

<p>Mrs. Burney could not say whether she would rather
that her charge became moody or hilarious.</p>

<p>“Eight separate curtsies,” murmured Fanny. “If
there are to be the same number going away we should
begin at once.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burney thought it better not to reprove her for
her flippancy just at that moment. She condoned it
with a smile.</p>

<p>Only a minute were the Burneys left to themselves.
Mr. Barlowe, the elder, walked solemnly up to them.</p>

<p>“Going on nicely, eh?” he said in a confidential way
to Mrs. Burney. “Everything being done decently and
in order, madam. There has been no cause of offence up
to the present, though there are three persons in that
row who are as ready to see an offence where none is
meant as a bunch of flax to break into flame when a
spark falls on it. The young lady is discreet; if she had
spoken to any one of them and not to the others, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
would have been a flare-up. The touchy ones belong to
my wife’s family. She was a Kensit, you know.”</p>

<p>He made this explanation behind his hand and in a
whisper; he saw that his wife and son had been in earnest
consultation together over some vexed question, and now
they were hovering about, waiting to catch his eye.</p>

<p>“I spoke too soon,” he said. “Something has gone
astray, and the blame will fall on me.”</p>

<p>They hovered still nearer, and when he caught his
eye, Thomas, the younger, stepped up to his father, saying
something in his ear. Mrs. Barlowe went on hovering
a yard or two away.</p>

<p>“That would never do,” said her husband, evidently
in reply to some remonstrance offered by young Thomas.
“Never. The whole of the Kensits would take offence.”
Then he turned again to Mrs. Burney, saying:</p>

<p>“Mrs. Burney, madam, my son has just reminded me
that I have been remiss in doing my duty. It was left
to me to present you to our relations at the head of the
room, but I failed to do so, my mind being too full of
the pretty curtsies of Miss. But I am ready to make
amends now.”</p>

<p>But Mrs. Burney had observed a little twinkle in
Fanny’s eye; she had no notion of going through the
ordeal to which Fanny had been subjected, though the
spectacle would doubtless have diverted Fanny hugely.</p>

<p>“Nay, sir,” she said quickly to the waiting gentleman,
“Nay sir; you have forgotten that the presentation of
a lady’s daughter is equivalent to the presentation of the
lady herself.”</p>

<p>“What, is that so?” said he.</p>

<p>“Rest assured that it is,” said she, “and an excellent
rule it is. It saves a repetition of a formality that is
now frequently omitted in the private houses of simple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
folk like ourselves. Lend me your arm, sir. I shall
soon make myself at home with Martha’s relations.”</p>

<p>She did not give him a chance of discussing the point
with her; she saw that he was about to state his objections
to the rule she had invented for her own saving,
and she was already in advance of him in approaching
the row of figures on the chairs against the wall. Fanny
heard her greeting them in turn without any formality,
and once again Thomas, the younger, was by her side.</p>

<p>His mother was still hovering, glancing suspiciously,
first at the young couple, and then at the hasty proceedings
of her friend, Mrs. Burney.</p>

<p>“It was unlike father to make so grave an omission,
Miss Burney,” he said, apologetically.</p>

<p>“I hope that no harm will come of it,” said Fanny.
“I am afraid that you found us very homely folk at our
little house when you did us the honour of visiting us,”
she added.</p>

<p>He waved his hand indulgently, smiling over her
head.</p>

<p>“I am always ready to take my place in such a circle,”
said he, “though all the time I have a pretty full
knowledge of the exchange of courtesies which should
mark the introduction of a stranger. Oh, yes, I do not
mind meeting some people as an equal, if they do not
presume upon me afterwards. Your brother has gone
back to sea, I hear?” he added.</p>

<p>“Yes, we shall not see him again for two years,” she
replied. “Did he presume upon you, sir? If so, I
will take it upon me to offer you a humble apology.”</p>

<p>“I was considering if it might be possible that he was
himself mistaken in regard to the ear-trumpet,” said
Thomas.</p>

<p>“Sir Joshua’s ear-trumpet? What of that?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>“Lieutenant Burney told me that it was a newly invented
musical instrument, blown by the ear instead of
the mouth. It was not until I had spoken of it to my
father that I learned that the instrument was an ear-trumpet
used by the deaf. I had never seen one before.
I wonder if your brother intentionally deceived me.”</p>

<p>“My brother is an officer in His Majesty’s Fleet, sir.”</p>

<p>“What does that mean, miss?”</p>

<p>“It means that he would resent an accusation of falsehood,
sir.”</p>

<p>“Pray do not misunderstand me; I would shrink from
accusing him of any conduct unworthy of an officer and
a gentleman. But I was certainly deceived in fancying
that the ear-trumpet was a musical instrument.”</p>

<p>Fanny made no reply. Her attention was directed to
the entrance of two servants, one bearing a large urn,
the other a dish on which lay an immense ham.</p>

<p>“I hope you have an appetite, Miss Burney,” said
young Thomas. “If so, you will be able to stay it at that
table, I’ll warrant. Tea and cake may be well enough
for such as dine at four, but for us, who are three hours
earlier, something more substantial is needed. You will
find that there is no stint in this house.”</p>

<p>Fanny had an idea that the young man meant to suggest
that she would find the tea-table at the Poultry to
make a striking contrast to that of St. Martin’s Street;
and she was not mistaken.</p>

<p>Neither was he. A greater contrast could scarcely be
imagined. When Fanny was formally conducted to a
seat at the table by the side of young Mr. Barlowe, she
found herself confronting such a variety of eatables as
was absolutely bewildering. The first glance that she
had at the dishes had a stunning effect upon her. Her
impression was one of repletion; she felt that that glance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
was by itself equivalent to a hearty meal—a heavy meal.
She felt inclined to turn her head away.</p>

<p>But a moment afterwards she became alert. Here was
food—ample food for an amusing letter to Mr. Crisp,
and, later for a chapter in a possible novel. She would
let nothing escape her notice.</p>

<p>She settled down to observe everything; and her stepmother,
sitting opposite to her, knew from the twinkle
in her eyes, that Thomas’s suit was hopeless. She had
heard that music is the food of love. She was not sure
of this; but she was convinced that butcher’s meat was
not. That was where she saw that Thomas had made his
mistake. He had placed too much dependence upon that
great ham. He carved that ham with all the solemnity
that should accompany such a rite, not knowing that he
was slicing away all his chances of commending himself
to Fanny.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<p>It was an interesting experience for Miss Burney, the
writer of novels and the writer of letters. She had
never sat down with such a company. They all had
their table peculiarities. One uncle took ale for his tea,
and drained a tankard before eating anything. The
other claimed a particular cup on account of its capacity,
and he held it to his mouth with one hand, while he
passed a second down the table to Miss Burney, only
spilling a spoonful or two in effecting the transit. One
of the aunts refused to eat anything except cake, explaining,
in order to relieve the anxiety of the company, the
details of an acute attack of spleen from which she had
recently suffered. The spleen and its humours formed
the subject of a fitful conversation at her end of the
table.</p>

<p>But it was plain that everyone understood that the
company had not come to the table for conversation, but
for food. They did not converse, but that was not
the same as saying the room was silent. There was a
constant clanging of cups, a constant clatter of
platters, a loud and insistent demand on the part of
Thomas, the elder, and Thomas, the younger, for
their guests to say what they would like to eat.
This was followed by the handing of plates up and
down the table, the sound of steel knives being
sharpened, and the jingle of spoons in saucers. The
Alderman, who was, of course, an authority on the etiquette
of banquets, was formulating an elaborate explanation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
of the mistake that had been made in the
service of the cold sirloin in advance of the venison
pasty; and all the time his neighbour was striking the
haft of his knife upon the table with a request for someone
to pass him the pickles.</p>

<p>All the ceremonial veneer had plainly left the company
the moment they seated themselves, and they addressed
themselves to the business of feeding. They had
healthy appetites—even the lady who had had a recent
attack of the spleen. She would eat nothing but cake,
but she did eat cake with confidence. There was no sort
of cake that she did not try, and her cup was kept in
constant circulation from the tea-maker to herself—four
times she had it refilled, Fanny could not help
noticing, and she wondered what effect such a diet would
have upon her capricious spleen. Fanny had an inward
hint or two that she had observed quite enough of the
party to serve her purpose, and she began to count the
moments until she might be able to steal away without
offending the susceptibilities of her over-hospitable host
and hostess. She hoped that her stepmother would listen
to her plea of weariness and take her back to St. Martin’s
Street—to the music of St. Martin’s Street—to the
quiet of St. Martin’s Street.</p>

<p>The most solid hour of her life had, however, to elapse
before her fellow-guests pushed their plates (empty)
away from them, and Mrs. Barlowe said:</p>

<p>“I am afraid you have made a poor tea, Miss Burney;
but if you cannot be persuaded to have a slice of ham—my
son’s ham, I call it, for ’tis he who picks it out of
the curer’s stock whenever we have a party—if you still
refuse it, we might go to the drawing-room.”</p>

<p>Fanny was on her feet in an instant. But not sooner
than Alderman Kensit. That gentleman, rapping with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
the haft of his knife on the table, stood with a sheaf of
notes in his hand and clearing his throat with great
deliberation, started upon a speech in eulogy of Mr. Barlowe’s
merits as a host and as a merchant, and droned
away for a good half-hour in praise of the virtue of
hospitality, his text being on the possibility of entertaining
angels unawares. Of course, it was only natural
that, having got upon this track and with the word
“angels” in his mind, he should go on to say that it
was quite possible for a hospitably-inclined person to
entertain an angel and be fully cognizant of the fact,
and so forth: in a speech of well-worn platitudes such
a suggestion seemed inevitable; and all eyes were
directed to poor Fanny when it seemed impending. It
was a great disappointment to everybody—except Fanny
and her stepmother—when the orator skipped the expected
phrases, and went on to describe a business visit
which he had once made to Spain, apropos of nothing in
particular. His account of this feat was familiar to all
his relations, but they listened to him without a murmur,
only wondering when he would come to the angel and
Miss Burney.</p>

<p>He never came to the angel and Miss Burney, for it
so happened that he had turned over two pages of his
notes when he should have only turned over one. The
omitted platitude was on the first, and he failed to
notice the absence of a platitudinal sequence in the heads
of his discourse which he had jotted down during the
day.</p>

<p>When he had seated himself, Mr. Barlowe, the elder,
got upon his feet, but he had no notes, and not being
a member of the Common Council, he was not a past-master
of commonplaces. He was only dull for about
five minutes instead of half an hour. He had risen with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
a view to repair his relative’s omission of that obvious
point about entertaining an angel by appointment in the
shape of Miss Burney, but he lost himself before he
managed to deliver it; it swam out of his ken with
several other points the moment he got upon his legs.</p>

<p>Fully recognizing how narrow was the escape she had
had, Fanny was resolved not to run any further chances.
She was looking imploringly toward Mrs. Burney, trying
to catch that lady’s eye, but without success, and she was
about to walk round the table to her side and to beg her
to come away, when Mrs. Barlowe moved up to her.</p>

<p>“Miss Burney,” she said, “I am afraid you did not
get anything you liked at the table: I saw that you
scarce ate more than a morsel of cake.”</p>

<p>“I assure you, madam, I had enough,” said Fanny.
“Your cake was so tasty I had no mind to go away from
it in search of other delicacies.”</p>

<p>“I am glad you liked it. I made it with my own
hands,” said the hostess. “That cake was ever a favourite
with Mr. Barlowe and my son. It pleases me to
know that you and my son have tastes in common. He
is a good son, is Thomas, though I say it that shouldn’t;
and he is making his way to the front by treading in his
father’s footsteps. Mr. Barlowe is not a Common
Councilman, but his father, Thomas’s grandfather, was
for a year Deputy-Master of the Wyre Drawers’ Company—his
certificate still hangs on the wall of the drawing-room.
You must see it. Thomas, you will show
Miss Burney your grandfather’s certificate as Deputy-Master.”</p>

<p>“I should like very much to see it,” said Fanny
quickly, “but I fear that mamma will wish me to accompany
her home at once. My sisters are alone to-night
and they will feel lonely: we promised to return early.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>“I will get Mrs. Burney’s permission for you—so good
an opportunity should not be thrown away,” said Mrs.
Barlowe, giving the latter part of her sentence an unmistakable
inflection as she looked toward her son and
smiled.</p>

<p>She had gone round the table before Fanny could
think of another excuse for evading the visit to the
drawing-room in the company of Mr. Barlowe, the
younger.</p>

<p>And Mr. Barlowe, the younger, was still by her side.</p>

<p>“Doesn’t Uncle Kensit make a fine speech?” he inquired.
“He is always ready. I have heard it said that
he speaks longer than any Alderman in the Council.”</p>

<p>“I can quite believe it,” replied Fanny.</p>

<p>“’Tis a wonderful gift,” said he—“to be always
ready to say what one is expected to say. Though I did
think that when he referred to the angels he meant to—to—go
farther—I mean nearer—nearer home.”</p>

<p>Thomas might himself have gone farther had his
mother not returned at that moment from her diplomatic
errand.</p>

<p>“I have prevailed upon Mrs. Burney to let you stay to
see the certificate,” said she. “Thomas, you will conduct
Miss Burney to the drawing-room.”</p>

<p>“I am sure that mamma would wish to see the certificate
also,” said Fanny. “I will ask her.”</p>

<p>“There is no need, Miss Burney: we shall all join you
later,” said Mrs. Barlowe.</p>

<p>Poor Fanny saw that there was no use trying to evade
the attentions of Thomas, and as she walked toward the
folding doors by his side she was conscious of a silence
in the room and of all eyes being turned upon her—smiles—such
knowing smiles—and a smirk from the
young lady. Fanny was aware of all, and what she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
too short-sighted to see she was able to imagine. She was
burning at the thought of all those people gazing at her
in silence. It was the most trying moment of her life.</p>

<p>She passed through the door which Thomas opened for
her and closed behind her.</p>

<p>“I am glad to have this opportunity, Miss Burney,”
said he, when they were alone in the big half-lighted
room.</p>

<p>“You must hold your grandfather’s certificate in high
esteem, sir,” said she. “I suppose so high a place as he
reached is but rarely attained by mortals. You will
have to guide me to the document; I have very poor eyesight,
as you must have noticed.”</p>

<p>“It is a great drawback,” said he. “But we will not
talk about grandfather’s certificate just yet, if you
please: I have something to say to you that will, I hope,
interest you even more than that.”</p>

<p>“You surprise me, sir,” said Fanny icily.</p>

<p>“Nay, I hope that you know me well enough not to be
surprised by all that I have to reveal to you now that the
opportunity has been given to me. Have you no inkling
of what I am about to say, Miss Burney?”</p>

<p>“Not the least, sir. I expected only to see that relic
of your grandfather’s honourable career.”</p>

<p>“What, after meeting Uncle Kensit and Aunt Jelicoe,
you do not feel interested in their families?” said he,
in a tone of genuine surprise.</p>

<p>Fanny looked at him before she spoke, and there certainly
was more than a note of casual interest in her
voice as she said:</p>

<p>“Their families? Oh, I should like above all things
to hear about their families.”</p>

<p>“I knew that you would,” said he, apparently much
relieved. (She wondered if the relief that she felt was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
as apparent as his.) “Yes, I felt certain that you would
welcome this opportunity of learning something about
the Kensits and the Jelicoes. They are remarkable
people, as you cannot have failed to perceive.”</p>

<p>He made a pause—a pause that somehow had an interrogative
tendency. She felt that he meant it to be
filled up by her.</p>

<p>“They are remarkable people—very remarkable,”
said she.</p>

<p>“We are very fortunate in all our relations, Miss
Burney,” said he with great solemnity. “But, of course,
Uncle Kensit stands high above them all in force of
character. A great man indeed is Alderman Kensit—a
member of the Haberdashers’ and Grocers’ Companies
as well as the City Council, and yet quite ready to meet
ordinary persons as fellow-men. He had heard the name
of your friend, Sir Joshua Reynolds, though not the
name of Dr. Burney, and he was kind enough to say that
he would have no objection in the world to meet either
of these gentlemen. That shows you what sort of man
he is—his fine, simple nature. ‘If Dr. Burney or Sir
Joshua Reynolds were duly presented to me, I should
feel it my duty to be civil to him’—those were his exact
words.”</p>

<p>Once more there was an interrogative pause.</p>

<p>“Perhaps they may be fortunate enough to meet him
some day,” was all Fanny could trust herself to say.</p>

<p>“I would not say so much to them—he is very busy
just now,” said Thomas hastily. “It would have to be
arranged with care and thought—I would not like them
to be disappointed. But if it would please you, I daresay
a meeting could be brought about; meantime, I
would not raise up any false hopes on the matter, if I
were you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>“You may depend on my preserving the strictest
secrecy, Mr. Barlowe,” said Fanny. “I should think
that I might even discipline myself to forget that such
a person as Alderman Kensit existed.”</p>

<p>“That would perhaps be the safest course to pursue,”
said he thoughtfully, and with an air of prudence that
made him for the moment the subject of a description
after Fanny’s own heart. She felt that she could fool
this young man as easily as her brother had fooled him.
Surely he was made to be fooled, with his solemn airs and
his incapacity to distinguish what is worthy from what
is pompous.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she continued, “Dr. Burney has had it intimated
to him since the publication of his ‘History’ that
the King was desirous of talking to him at Windsor, and
I know that Sir Joshua is being visited daily by the
Duchess of Devonshire and the Duchess of Ancaster, and
it would be a great pity if my father were forced to
write excusing himself to His Majesty on account of
having to meet Alderman—Alderman—I protest that I
have already forgotten the gentleman’s name—nay, do
not tell it to me; I might be tempted to boast of having
met him, and if I did so in Sir Joshua’s presence, his
beautiful Duchesses would be forlorn when they found
that he had hurried away on the chance of meeting the
Alderman. And now, sir, I think that I shall return
to Mrs. Burney.”</p>

<p>“But I have not told you half of what I can tell about
our family,” he cried. “I have said nothing about my
aunts—I have four aunts and eleven cousins. You
would surely like to hear of my cousins. They do not
all live in London. I have three as far away as Lewes;
their name is Johnson. My mother’s youngest sister
married a Johnson, as you may have heard. I believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
that some objection was raised to the match at first, but
it turned out quite satisfactory.”</p>

<p>“It is pleasant to know that; and so, sir, as we have
come to this point, don’t you think that we had better
adjourn our conference?” said Fanny. “It would be
doing the Johnson family a grave injustice were you to
attempt to describe their virtues within the time that is
left to us, and that would be the greatest catastrophe of
all. Besides, I came hither all unprepared for these
revelations. If you had hinted at what was in store for
me I would, of course, have disciplined myself—forewarned
is forearmed, you know.”</p>

<p>Miss Burney had received many a lesson from Mr.
Garrick, from the days when he had come to entertain
her in the nursery, in the art of fooling, and she was now
quite capable of holding her own when she found herself
in the presence of so foolable a person as this egregious
young man. But the game was apt to become wearisome
at the close of an evening when she had suffered
much, and when the subject of her raillery had shown
himself to be incapable even of suspecting her of practising
on him.</p>

<p>“But there is Aunt Jelicoe; I should like to tell you
something of Aunt Jelicoe,” pleaded Thomas. “Without
any of the advantages of her parents, Aunt Jelicoe—and—oh,
I have something more to say to you—not
about them—about ourselves—you and me—I was nearly
forgetting—you will stay—”</p>

<p>“One cannot remember everything, Mr. Barlowe,”
said Fanny, with her hand on the knob of the door.
“You have done very well, I think, in remembering so
much as you have told me. As for ourselves—you have
quite convinced me of my own insignificance—and
yours also, sir. You would be doing us a grave injustice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
were you to speak of us so soon after your estimable
relations.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you are right,” said he, after a few moments
of frowning thought. “Yes. I see now that it
might have been wiser if I had begun with ourselves and
then—”</p>

<p>Fanny had turned the handle. She re-entered the
dining-room, and the moment that she appeared silence
fell upon the company, and once again she was conscious
of many eyes gazing at her and of horrid smiles and a
smirk. That was another ordeal for the shy little Miss
Burney—it was an evening of ordeals.</p>

<p>She walked straight across the room to her stepmother.</p>

<p>“I am ready to go away now,” she said. “We have
never stayed at any house so long when we only came for
tea. I am tired to death.”</p>

<p>She took care, of course, that Mrs. Burney only should
hear her; and Mrs. Burney, being well aware that Fanny
was not one to complain unless with ample cause, charitably
interposed between her and Mrs. Barlowe, whom
she saw bearing down upon her from the other side of
the room.</p>

<p>“Fanny and I will say our good-night to you now, my
dear Martha,” she said. “You have treated us far too
kindly. That must be our excuse for staying so long.
When people drop in to tea they do not, as a rule, stop
longer than an hour, as you know. But you overwhelmed
us.”</p>

<p>“I was hoping—” began Mrs. Barlowe, trying to get
on to Fanny, but by the adroitness of Mrs. Burney, not
succeeding. “I was hoping—you know what I was
hoping—we were all hoping—expecting—they were in
the drawing-room long enough.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Burney gave her a confidential look, which she
seemed to interpret easily enough. She replied by a
confidential nod—the nod of one who understands a
signal.</p>

<p>“Mum it shall be, then,” she whispered. “Not a
word will come from me, simply good-night; but we
could all have wished—never mind, Thomas will tell us
all.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burney allowed her to pass on to Fanny, having
obtained her promise not to bother the girl—that was
how Mrs. Burney framed the promise in her own mind—and
Mrs. Barlowe kept faith with her, and even persuaded
Alderman Kensit, who was approaching them
slowly with a sheaf of notes in his hand, to defer their
delivery in the form of a speech until the young woman
had gone.</p>

<p>And thus the visitors from St. Martin’s Street were
able to escape going through the formality of taking
leave of all the party. They shook hands only with
their host and hostess and their son, curtseying very
politely to the company of relations.</p>

<p>“They are warm-hearted people, but their weakness
for ceremony and the like is foolish enough,” said Mrs.
Burney to Fanny, when they were safe within the hackney
carriage.</p>

<p>Fanny laughed.</p>

<p>“Oh, indeed, there is no harm in any of them,” she
said. “They may be a little foolish in thinking that the
Poultry is St. James’s Palace or Buckingham House.
The only one among them who is an arrant fool is the
son. You saw how his mother made it up that he should
lead me into the other room?”</p>

<p>“It was maladroitly done indeed. What had he to say
to you when he got you there, I wonder?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>“He had nothing to say to me except that his uncles
were second in all the virtues and all the talents to no
man in town, and that his aunts and cousins—but he
did not get so far in his praise of his aunts and cousins;
I fled. Oh, did you see him cut slices off the ham?”</p>

<p>Fanny laughed quite pleasantly, with a consciousness
of having at her command the material on which to
found a scene that would set her sisters shrieking.</p>

<p>“Oh, if Mr. Garrick had but seen him carve that
ham!” she cried.</p>

<p>“I wish that Mr. Garrick would give all his attention
to his own affairs and leave us to manage ours in our
own way,” said Mrs. Burney.</p>

<p>“What? Why, what had Mr. Garrick to do with our
visit to—”</p>

<p>“’Twas Mr. Garrick who continued his fooling of
Mr. Kendal, sending him all over the town trying to
make matches. He believes that he is under a debt of
gratitude to Mr. Garrick and your father for the happiness
he enjoys with his bride.”</p>

<p>“And he suggested that a match might be made between
someone in St. Martin’s Street and someone in the
Poultry? But how does Mr. Kendal come to be
acquainted with the Barlowes?”</p>

<p>“His wife was a Johnson before she married her first
husband, and the Johnsons are closely connected with the
Barlowes.”</p>

<p>“Young Mr. Barlowe was just coming to the family
history of the Johnsons when I interrupted him.”</p>

<p>“Was he coming to any other matter that concerned
you more closely, think you?”</p>

<p>Fanny laughed again, only much longer this time than
before. She had to wipe her eyes before she could
answer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>“Dear mamma,” she said, “you would laugh as
heartily if you had seen him when he suddenly recollected
that in his eagerness to make me acquainted with
the glories of the Kensits and the abilities of the Johnsons,
he had neglected the object of his excursion to that
room with my poor self, until it was too late.”</p>

<p>“I doubt it,” said Mrs. Burney. “I do not laugh at
incidents of that sort. I lose patience when I hear of
a young man neglecting his chances when they are offered
to him. But had he ever a chance with you,
Fanny?”</p>

<p>“Not the remotest, dear mamma. If he had remembered
to speak in time, and if he had spoken with all the
eloquence of his admirable uncle, the Alderman, he
would not have succeeded. If Thomas Barlowe were the
last man in the world I should e’en die an old maid.”</p>

<p>“That is a foolish thing for you to say. You may die
an old maid for that. But indeed when I saw young
Mr. Barlowe in his home, I perceived that he was not for
you. I could not see you a member of that family,
worthy though they may be.”</p>

<p>“I think if a girl loves a young man with all her heart
she will agree to marry him, however worthy may be his
family,” said Fanny. “But I am not that girl, and
young Mr. Barlowe is not that man.”</p>

<p>“I daresay that is how you feel,” said the elder lady.
“But you must not forget, Fanny, that you are no longer
a girl; it is quite time that you had a house of your
own.”</p>

<p>“That is true, dear mamma, but for the present I am
happy in living in your house, and I ask for nothing
better than to be allowed to stay in your service.”</p>

<p>“That is all very well, but—”</p>

<p>“Ah, do not introduce that ‘but’—life would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
thoroughly happy if it were not for its ‘buts.’ Here
we are in Leicester Fields. I feel as if I should like a
roast apple for supper, to put a pleasant taste in my
mouth at the close of the longest day I can remember.”</p>

<p>They entered the parlour on the ground floor, and
found Lottie and Susy roasting apples on the hearth,
while Dr. Burney sat in his chair reading.</p>

<p>“I did not expect you back so soon,” said Mrs. Burney
to her husband.</p>

<p>“I did not mean to return for another hour,” said he,
“but Sir Joshua left early and brought me with him in
his coach. He cut his evening short in order to get back
to a book which he affirms is the best he has read since
Fielding.”</p>

<p>“It would have to be a good book to take the attention
of Sir Joshua,” said Mrs. Burney. “Did you hear
what was its name?”</p>

<p>“It is called ‘Evelina,’ I believe,” replied Dr. Burney.</p>

<p>“A novel, of course. I remember hearing the name
some time ago,” said his wife. “‘Evelina’; yes, it has
a familiar sound. I cannot recollect at this moment who
it was that mentioned it to me. I believe I told you of
it at the time, Fanny.”</p>

<p>“I do not remember your telling me that anyone had
mentioned it to you; but I am nearly sure that that was
the name of the novel advertised in the <cite>Chronicle</cite>—you
read out all about it after breakfast one morning,” said
Fanny.</p>

<p>“You are quite right—that was how I got the name
in my mind. Now you can have your roasted apple,
child. But if you are hungry you have only yourself to
thank for it. Don’t bend so over the fire, Susy; your
face is frightfully red—so, for that matter, is Lottie’s.
No, thanks, you need not roast one for me.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<p>Some weeks had passed since Cousin Edward had
brought his exhilarating news that the book was
being asked for at the libraries, and during this interval,
Fanny had heard nothing of its progress. She had applied
in the name of Mr. Grafton for a copy to be addressed
to the Orange Coffee House, but Mr. Lowndes
had paid no attention to her request, Edward found out
on going to the Coffee House, so it seemed plain to Fanny
that the book was not making the stir in the world that
her cousin’s report from the libraries had attributed to
it. But here was a distinct proof that it had at last
reached their own circle, and somehow Fanny and her
sisters felt that this meant fame. Somehow they had
come to think of the readers of the book as being very
remote from them—people whom they were never likely
to meet; they had never thought of the possibility of its
being named under their own roof by anyone not in the
secret of its authorship. But now the strange thing had
come to pass: it was not only named by their father,
but named with the most extraordinary recommendation
that it could receive!</p>

<p>What! Sir Joshua was not only reading it, but he
had curtailed his stay at the club in order to get home
to continue it! Sir Joshua had actually been content
to forsake the society of his brilliant friends, every one
of them more or less notable in the world, in order that
he might read the story which Fanny Burney had written
all out of her own head!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>The idea was simply astounding to the girls and to
Fanny herself as well. It meant fame, they were assured,
and they were right. It took such a hold upon
Susy and Lottie as prevented them from giving any attention
to Fanny’s amusing account of the evening at
the Barlowes’; and the fun she made—modelled on Mr.
Garrick’s best nursery style—of the Alderman and Mrs.
Alderman, with the speeches of the one and the St.
Giles’s curtsies of the other, went for quite as little as
did her imitation of the bobbing of the crown feathers of
the aunts and the rustling of their dresses, the material
of which was too expensive to be manageable: the thick
silk was, Fanny said, like a valuable horse, impatient of
control. She showed how it stood round them in massive
folds when they curtsied, refusing to respond to the
many kicks they dealt it to keep it in its place.</p>

<p>From the recalcitrant silks—with illustrations—Fanny
had gone to the slicing of the ham, the hacking at the
great sirloin, the clatter of the teacups, and the never-ending
passing of plates and pickles, of mustard and
pepper and salt—the things were moving round the table
as the planets were shown circling round the sun in the
clever invention called the Orrery, after one of the titles
of the Earl of Cork—only the noise made by the perpetual
handing on of the things did not suggest the
music of the spheres, Fanny said.</p>

<p>Her descriptions, bright though they were and full of
apt metaphors, went for nothing. Her sisters were too
full of that wonderful thing which had happened—the
great Sir Joshua Reynolds, President of the Royal Academy,
the painter of all the most beautiful duchesses that
were in the world, to say nothing of beautiful ladies of
less exalted rank—this great man, who was so busy conferring
immortality upon duchesses that he was compelled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
to keep in his painting-room on Sundays as well
as every other day, and who had never been known to
suspend his work except upon the occasion of the death
of his dear friend Dr. Goldsmith—this man was actually
at that very moment sitting in his arm-chair eagerly
reading the words which their sister Fanny had written!</p>

<p>The thought was too wonderful for them. The effect
that it had on them was to make them feel that they had
two sisters in Fanny, the one a pleasant, homely, hem-stitching
girl, who could dance the Nancy Dawson jig for
them and take off all the people whom she met and
thought worth taking off; the other a grave authoress,
capable of writing books that great men forsook the
society of other great men to read!</p>

<p>They looked on her now with something of awe in
their eyes, and it was this lens of awe which, while magnifying
her work as a writer where it came into their
focus, made them fail to appreciate her fun, for they
saw it, as it were, through the edges of the lens and not
through the centre.</p>

<p>She quickly perceived the lack of sympathy of her
audience.</p>

<p>“What is the matter with you both to-night?” she
cried—they were now upstairs in her room, and she
knew that at the same moment Mrs. Burney was giving
her husband an account of the party. “What is the
matter with you both? Has anything happened when
I was away to put you out? Why don’t you laugh as
usual? I am sure I never told you anything half so
funny as this, and I was thinking all the way coming
home that it would make you roar, and now you sit
gravely looking at me and not taking in half I say.
Pray, what is the matter?”</p>

<p>“Nothing is the matter, dear,” said Lottie. “Nothing—only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
I can’t help thinking that Sir Joshua is at this
moment sitting eagerly reading the book that you wrote—you,
sister Fanny, that no one who comes to us notices
particularly. I can hardly bring myself to believe that
there is only one Fanny.”</p>

<p>Fanny looked at her strangely for some moments, and
then said:</p>

<p>“I do not blame you, dear; for I am myself of the
same way of thinking: I cannot realize what the padre
told us. I cannot think of myself as the Fanny Burney
whose book is keeping Sir Joshua out of his bed. That
is why I kept on harping like a fool on the single string
of that odious party. I feel that I must keep on talking,
lest my poor brain should give way when I sit down to
think if I am really Fanny Burney, who was ever happiest
sitting unnoticed in a corner when people came to this
house, or laughing with you all up here. I cannot think
how it would be possible for me to write a book that
could be read by such as Sir Joshua.”</p>

<p>“Better think nothing more about it,” said Susy, who
fancied she saw a strange look in Fanny’s eyes.
“What’s the good of brooding over the matter? There’s
nothing strange about Sir Joshua’s reading the book:
I read it and I told you that it was so lovely everybody
would want to read it. Besides, Sir Joshua may only
have mentioned it for want of a better excuse to leave
the club early; so you may not be so famous after all,
Fanny.”</p>

<p>Susy’s well-meant attempt to restore her threatened
equilibrium was too much for Fanny. But there was a
considerable interval before her laughter came. She
put an arm about Susy, saying:</p>

<p>“You have spoken the truth, my dear sister. I have
no right to give myself airs until we find out exactly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
how we stand. But if Fanny Burney, the dunce, should
find out to-morrow that Sir Joshua has not really been
kept out of his bed in order to read ‘Evelina’ by Fanny
Burney, the writer, the first Fanny will feel dreadfully
mortified.”</p>

<p>“One thing I can promise you,” said Susy, “and this
is that Susannah Burney will not be kept out of her bed
any longer talking to Fanny Burney about Fanny Burney’s
novel, whether Fanny Burney be mortified or not.
We shall know all about the matter when we go to the
Reynolds’s to-morrow. In the meantime, I hope to have
some hours of sleep, though I daresay that Fanny Burney
will lie awake as a proper authoress should do, thinking
over the exciting party in the Poultry and wondering
how she will work in a description of it in her next
novel. Good-night, and pleasant dreams! Come along,
Lottie.”</p>

<p>And Fanny Burney did just what her sister had predicted
she would do. She recalled some of the incidents
of the tea-party in the Poultry, having before her, not as
she had in the hackney coach, the possibility of describing
them in a letter to Mr. Crisp, but of introducing
them into a new book.</p>

<p>Before she slept she had made up her mind to begin a
new book; for she now found it comparatively easy to
believe that Sir Joshua was reading “Evelina” with
great interest. At any rate, she would hear the next
day when she should go to the Reynolds’s, whether Sir
Joshua had read it, or whether he had only made it an
excuse for getting home early in the night, so that he
might arise early and refreshed to resume his painting
of the duchesses.</p>

<p>But the next evening, when, with her sisters and their
stepmother she tripped along the hundred yards or so of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
Leicester Fields that lay between their house and that of
Sir Joshua Reynolds, all thoughts of the book which she
had written and of the book which she meant to write,
vanished the moment that she was close enough to Sir
Joshua’s to hear, with any measure of clearness, the
nature of the singing, the sound of which fell gently upon
her ears.</p>

<p>“H’sh!” said Mrs. Burney, stopping a few feet from
the door. “H’sh! some one is singing. I did not know
that it was to be a musical party.”</p>

<p>“It is Signor Rauzzini,” said Lottie. “I would know
his voice anywhere. We are lucky. There is no one
who can sing like Signor Rauzzini.”</p>

<p>“We should have come earlier,” said Mrs. Burney.
“But when Miss Reynolds asked us she did not say a
word about Rauzzini. And now we cannot ring the bell,
lest we should interrupt his song.”</p>

<p>She stood there with the three girls, under the lighted
windows of the house, listening to the silvery notes of
the young Roman that floated over their heads, as if an
angel were hovering there, filling their ears with celestial
music. (The simile was Susy’s.) The music sounded
celestial to the ears of at least another of the group
besides Susy; and that one thought:</p>

<p>“How can anyone trouble oneself with such insignificant
matters as the writing of books or the reading of
books, when such a voice as that is within hearing?”</p>

<p>And then, all at once, she was conscious of the merging
of the two Fanny Burneys into one, and of the existence
of a new Fanny Burney altogether—the Fanny
Burney who was beloved by the celestial singer, and this
was certainly the most wonderful of the three.</p>

<p>The thought thrilled her, and she knew that with it
the truth of life had come to her: there was nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
worth anything in the world save only loving and being
loved.</p>

<p>And this truth remained with her when the song had
come to an end, soaring to a high note and dwelling on it
for an enraptured space and then dying away, so gradually
that a listener scarcely knew when it had ceased.</p>

<p>Fanny’s imagination enabled her to hear, at the close,
the drawing-in of the breath of the people in the room
where the song had been sung: she knew that up to this
point they had been listening breathlessly to every note.
She could hear the same soft inspiration—it sounded
like a sigh—by her sisters and their stepmother. A
dozen wayfarers through Leicester Fields had been attracted
to the house by the sound of the singing, and
now stood timidly about the doorway. They also had
been breathless. One woman murmured “Beautiful!”
Fanny could understand how the word had sprung to
her lips, but what could the man mean, who, almost at
the same moment, said:</p>

<p>“Oh, my God! how could I have been so great a fool?”</p>

<p>She was startled, and glanced at him. He was a
young man, shabbily dressed, and on his face there were
signs of dissipation. He was unconscious of her glance
for some moments, then with a slight start he seemed to
recover himself. He took off his hat with a respectful
bow, and then hurried away. But Fanny saw him turn
when he had gone about a dozen yards into the roadway,
and take off his hat once more, with his eyes looking up
to the lighted windows of the house. He was saluting
the singer whom he had not seen, and to Fanny the act,
following the words which he had unwittingly uttered,
was infinitely pathetic.</p>

<p>It appeared that Mrs. Burney herself received the
same impression. Fanny was surprised to hear her say:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>“Poor fellow! he was once a gentleman!”</p>

<p>Then they entered Sir Joshua’s house and were shown
upstairs to the great painting-room where Sir Joshua
and his sister Frances were receiving their guests.</p>

<p>It was quite a small party—not more than a score of
people altogether, and all seemed to be acquainted with
one another. Fanny knew several of them; one girl,
however, she had never seen before, but she knew who
she was in a moment. She was standing at one end of
the room chatting to Mrs. Sheridan and on the wall just
above her there hung the picture of a girl in oriental
costume and wearing a turban. Fanny Burney had
often looked at it in admiration, and Sir Joshua had
encouraged her, affirming that it was the best picture he
had ever painted and that it would remain in his painting-room
until the day of his death. She looked at it
now with renewed interest, for the original was the girl
standing beneath it—the beautiful Miss Horneck whom
Oliver Goldsmith had called the Jessamy Bride. Several
years had passed since Sir Joshua had painted that portrait,
from which Miss Burney had recognized the original;
and fifty years later another lady recognized the
same face, still beautiful in old age, from having seen
merely a print of the same picture.</p>

<p>When Fanny turned her eyes from the portrait it was
to admire the features of Mrs. Sheridan. Mrs. Sheridan
was gazing somewhat pensively at the picture of St.
Cecilia which was hanging a little way from that of Miss
Horneck, and Fanny was near enough to her to perceive
how her expression grew into that of the face in the
picture. At first sight, it did not appear to Fanny that
the two faces were the same, and it seemed as if Mrs.
Sheridan perceived this, and determined to vindicate Sir
Joshua’s skill by assuming the pose of the picture. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
Miss Burney knew that the beautiful lady had done it
unconsciously—that it was simply because she was recalling
the days when she had sat for the painter, and
had obeyed his injunction to lose herself among the
simple chords of the aria that was sacred to her since
her sister died with the strain upon her lips—“I know
that my Redeemer liveth.”</p>

<p>Fanny gazed at the exquisite face, illuminated with
what seemed to her to be a divine light, and for the first
time she knew something of what it was to be a great
painter. After “St. Cecilia” the other portraits on the
walls seemed paltry. There was no divine light in the
faces of the duchesses. There was life in them; they
breathed and smiled and posed and looked gracious, but
looking at them one remained on earth and among mortals.
But St. Cecilia carried one into the glorious company
of the immortals. “She drew an angel down,”
was the line that flashed through Miss Burney’s mind at
that moment. An angel? A whole celestial company.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>

<p>“You are looking at her—I, too, have been looking
at her; she is divine,” came a voice beside her.
She did not need to turn to see the speaker.
She had been longing for the sound of his voice for many
days. She had not even a chance of hearing him sing
before this evening.</p>

<p>“She is St. Cecilia herself,” said she. “You have
seen Sir Joshua’s picture?”</p>

<p>“My countryman, Piozzi, pointed it out to me,” he
replied. “I was enraptured with the picture. But
when the living St. Cecilia entered the room and I heard
her story, I felt ready to throw myself at her feet and
implore her as the guardian of poor singers to take me to
her care. Her face has on it the bloom of a flower
dropped fresh from the garden of God—angelic beyond
the voice of man to describe.”</p>

<p>He spoke, as usual, in French to Fanny, but he had
greeted Mrs. Burney in English, and he tried to translate
his last phrase to her into the same language. He failed
after the first word or two, and begged Miss Burney to
complete his task for him. She did so, and her stepmother
smiled and nodded in appreciation of his comment.</p>

<p>“She is indeed a beautiful creature,” said Mrs. Burney.
“I heard her sing more than once at Bath.
People went mad about her beauty and her singing,
and truly I never heard any singing that so affected me.
It was said that she hated to let her voice be heard in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
public. Her father, Mr. Linley, made her sing: she was
a gold mine to Mr. Linley and he knew it.”</p>

<p>Signor Rauzzini had listened attentively and picked
up all that she had said without the aid of a word from
Fanny.</p>

<p>“But now she will never be heard again no more,”
said he in English. “And she is right in making such a
resolution, and her husband is a noble man to agree with
her in this,” he continued, but in French to Fanny.
“Picture that lovely creature placing herself on the level
of such a one as the Agujari! sordid—vulgar—worldly!
quarrelling daily with the <i lang="it">impresario</i> on some miserable
question of precedence—holding out for the largest
salary—turning a gift which should be divine into gold!
Oh; she was right.”</p>

<p>“Signor Rauzzini no doubt thinks it a pity that such
a voice should cease to give pleasure to the thousands it
enchanted,” said Mrs. Burney, not being able to follow
him in French.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, no; just the opposite,” cried Fanny. “He
says he admires her the more for her resolution.”</p>

<p>“I am so glad. Pray tell him that I agree with him,”
said Mrs. Burney. “A good woman will avoid publicity.
Her home should be sufficient for her.”</p>

<p>Fanny did not need to translate the words, he grasped
their meaning at once.</p>

<p>“I agree with all of my heart, madame,” he cried. “I
would not wish my mother or my sister to have their
names spoken with freedom by everyone who paid a coin
to hear them sing. I should think it—<i lang="it">come si chiamo?</i>—Ah!
forgive my poor English.” He went off into
French once more—“Pray tell madame that I think it
would be odious to hear the name of my mother or my
sister tossed from man to man as they toss the name of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
woman who comes before the public. I think the woman
who would hide herself from all eyes as a violet hides
itself under a leaf is the true woman. The shy, timid,
retiring one—I know her—I esteem her. I could love
no other. I have a deep respect for the woman of the
Orient who would die sooner than let her face be seen
by a man.”</p>

<p>“What does he say—I like his eagerness?” asked Mrs.
Burney.</p>

<p>Fanny translated some of his phrases, and Mrs. Burney
nodded and smiled her approval.</p>

<p>“The bloom on the wing of a butterfly is a very
tender thing,” resumed the Roman; “the breath of a
man is sufficient to remove it—a single breath—and
when the bloom has gone the charm of the beautiful
creature has gone also.”</p>

<p>“I am not sure that I like the comparison to the butterfly,”
said Fanny, smiling. “The butterfly is the
emblem of all that is fickle—all that is idle except for its
yielding to its fickleness. It is beautiful, but nothing
else.”</p>

<p>He laughed.</p>

<p>“I am rebuked,” he said. “But with us the butterfly
is the symbol of the life—of the soul. Assume that and
you will, I think, see that I meant not to hint at the
beauty of the frivolity, but at the beauty of the soul. I
feel that a woman’s life has on it the bloom of a butterfly’s
wing, and if that is once breathed on, its beauty is
gone for ever—the woman’s life is never again what it
was—what it was meant to be. But if you wish, I will
not go beyond the violet as my emblem of the best woman—my
woman.”</p>

<p>“I thank heaven that I have no voice,” said Fanny
gently, after a pause. Young Mr. Northcote, Sir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
Joshua’s pupil, had approached Mrs. Burney—his eye
was on Susy—in order to tell her that tea was being
served in the drawing-room.</p>

<p>Mrs. Burney thanked him and took the arm that he
offered.</p>

<p>“We shall all go in together,” said Mrs. Burney, with
a sign to Fanny.</p>

<p>But Rauzzini contrived to evade her eye by renewing
his admiration of the “St. Cecilia.”</p>

<p>“If I could but reproduce in song the effect that flows
from her face I should be the greatest singer in the
world,” said he.</p>

<p>“You need not envy her,” said Fanny. “Do you
remember Mr. Handel’s setting of ‘Alexander’s Feast’?”</p>

<p>“Only an aria or two.”</p>

<p>“One of the lines came into my mind just now when
I looked at that picture. ‘She drew an angel down.’”</p>

<p>“And it was very apt. She would draw an angel
down.”</p>

<p>“Yes; but the poet has another line before that one—it
refers to a singer—‘He raised a mortal to the skies.’
That was the line which came to my mind when I heard
you sing. You raise mortals to the skies. Your power
is equal to that of St. Cecilia.”</p>

<p>“Nay, nay; that is what you have done. I have been
uplifted to the highest heaven by you. When you are
near me I cannot see anything of the world. Why have
we not met more frequently? Ah, I forgot—I am
always forgetting that the months you spoke of have not
yet run out. But I am not impatient, knowing that the
prize will come to me in good time. I have been away
at the Bath and Salisbury and Bristol and I know not
where, singing, singing, singing, and now I go to Paris
and Lyon for a few months, but you may be certain that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
I shall return to England—then the separating months
shall have passed and you will welcome me—is not that
so?”</p>

<p>“I think I can promise you—every day seems to make
it more certain that I shall welcome you.”</p>

<p>“My angel—my dream!—”</p>

<p>He said the words—both long-drawn monosyllables in
French—in a whisper that gave them the full force of
passionate expression. He had need to whisper, for several
people were in the room, and Mr. Boswell was among
the number, and everyone knew that Mr. Boswell, as a
gossip-monger, had no equal in town. He was always
pimping and prying—nosing out germs of scandal—ever
ready to make mischief by telling people all the nasty
things other people had said of them. Mr. Boswell had
his eye on them—and his ear. In addition, Mrs. Thrale,
who had arrived late, had no idea of allowing the handsome
Roman singer to waste himself with a nonentity
like Miss Burney, and she was now perilously close to him
whom she came to rescue.</p>

<p>But the whisper and the expression imparted to it
were enough for Fanny Burney. He might have talked
for hours in his impassioned way without achieving the
effect of his whispered exclamations.</p>

<p>Then Mrs. Thrale hastened up to his side full of her
resolution to rescue him from the conversation with the
insignificant person whom his good nature suffered to
engage his attention.</p>

<p>“Why, what is this?” cried the little lady who regarded
herself with complacency as the soul of tact. “Have
you explained to Signor Rauzzini that you are the unmusical
member of the family, Miss Burney?”</p>

<p>“I believe that he is aware of that fact already,
madam,” replied Fanny.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>“And yet he is in close converse with you? He is the
most good-natured man in town,” said Mrs. Thrale.
“Does he hope to interest you when your father failed?”</p>

<p>“He has never ceased to interest me, madam,” said
Fanny.</p>

<p>“Then he did not talk about music?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; I think he said something about music.”</p>

<p>“Yes, touching a note here and there, as one might in
passing a harpsichord. Of course you could not have
lived in Dr. Burney’s house without being able to understand
something of music. But we must not trespass
upon Signor Rauzzini’s courtesy, Miss Burney. Everyone
is talking of him in the drawing-room—he must
gratify the company by mingling with them.”</p>

<p>Then she addressed Rauzzini in French.</p>

<p>“I promised to go in search of you, signor,” she said.
“Madame Reynolds is distracted. I came on my mission
famished—I had vowed, as the crusaders did, not to
taste food or drink until I had succeeded in my emprise.
May I ask you to have pity on me now and lead me to
the tea-table?”</p>

<p>He turned to ask Fanny to accompany them, but he
found that she had slipped quietly away. She was
already at the door.</p>

<p>“My duty was to Miss Burney, madame, but she has
been frightened away,” said he.</p>

<p>“Oh, she is the shy one of the family, I believe,” said
Mrs. Thrale. “I am sure that all the time you were so
good-natured as to talk to her she was wishing that the
floor would open and allow her to sink out of sight. She
would have thought it much more good-natured on your
part if you had taken no notice of her. I have scarcely
spoken to her half a dozen times myself, though I have
frequently been to her father’s house. I cannot rack my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
brain to discover a congenial topic with such young
people. Were you successful, do you think?”</p>

<p>He made a gesture with his hands that might mean
anything. Mrs. Thrale assumed that it meant nothing—that
he felt he was not greatly concerned whether he had
been successful in finding a congenial topic of converse
with Miss Burney or not.</p>

<p>She laughed.</p>

<p>“Poor girl!” she said. “She may have her dreams
like other girls.”</p>

<p>“I believe she has—poor girl!” said he. “But I know
that in her knowledge of music she goes deeper—soars
higher than most young ladies who have submitted to
lessons from a <i lang="it">maestro</i>—nay, higher than the <i lang="it">maestro</i>
himself.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Thrale looked doubtfully at him.</p>

<p>“Is it possible that we are talking of two different
people?” said she.</p>

<p>“Ah, that is quite possible,” said he.</p>

<p>“I was referring to Miss Burney, the one of the family
who does nothing except sew—her mother commends her
sewing very highly. I fear that you actually believed
that you were in converse with one of her sisters.”</p>

<p>“Madame,” said he, “it is my belief that the one who
sews in a family is far more interesting than the one who
sings. But Miss Burney need not, in my eyes, be any
more than Miss Burney to be interesting, though she has
taught me more of music than I ever learned before.”</p>

<p>“Is’t possible? Oh, yes: I should remember that her
father told me that she was his amanuensis—she made a
neat copy of all his notes for the ‘History of Music.’ It
is no wonder that she knows something about it. Such a
good daughter! And the father took no trouble about
her education. She did not know her letters till she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
eight or nine, I believe—perhaps twelve. I don’t believe
that I ever exchanged half a dozen words with her before
this evening; and as for men—you are the first man I
ever saw taking any notice of her.”</p>

<p>His face lit up strangely, Mrs. Thrale thought, at this
revelation. He gave a laugh.</p>

<p>“So much the better for her—so much the worse for
the men,” said he. “And now, madame, if the tea has
not become too strong, and if your hunger has not made
you too weak to walk to the table, I should esteem it an
honour to conduct you thither.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Thrale smiled her acquiescence, and she entered
the drawing-room on the arm of the singer. Nothing
could have convinced her that he did not feel grateful to
her for rescuing him from the position in which his good
nature had placed him—by the side of the most insignificant
young woman among all Sir Joshua’s guests.</p>

<p>She believed that she was increasing his debt of gratitude
to her by keeping him with her for the next half-hour.
Her sense of protecting him gave her naturally a
sense of patronage, which was quite pleasant for her to
experience, especially when she glanced round the room
and saw several ladies of higher rank than she could pretend
to, frowning in her direction. She knew how Signor
Rauzzini was pestered by the attentions of such as
these, and she could almost hear the well-bred sneers of
her friends as they glanced at her and wondered if she
never meant to release the unfortunate young man—she
knew just what they would say, and she accepted their
imaginary words as a real compliment to her protective
powers. Her smile down the table was one of great
complacency.</p>

<p>She also noticed that the insignificant Miss Burney
was glowing as she had never seen her glow before. Her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
face was rosy and her eyes were actually sparkling.
Mrs. Thrale had never imagined that such eyes as Miss
Burney’s could sparkle, no matter what their provocation
might be.</p>

<p>“Poor girl! Poor child! Her head is turned, as I
feared it would be when I saw the Rauzzini with her.
She is the unhappy victim of his good nature.”</p>

<p>This was the conclusion come to by the little lady
whose ability to pronounce an opinion on such a matter
was widely acknowledged; and coming to such a conclusion,
she naturally commended all the more heartily
the step which she had taken for separating the foolish
girl and the fascinating young man.</p>

<p>She would have waved aside any suggestion that might
be made to her to the effect that the increase in Miss
Burney’s colouring and the light in her eyes was due to
Miss Burney’s overhearing the conversation between her
mother and Sir Joshua respecting a book which he had
stayed up all night to read and which he had just finished
in time to receive his guests.</p>

<p>The name of the book was “Evelina; or, a Young
Lady’s Entrance into the World,” he said, and he was
urging Mrs. Burney to follow his example and read it
without further delay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>

<p>Fanny was at her stepmother’s elbow while Sir
Joshua gave her a full account of how he had been
induced to send to Lowndes for this wonderful book on
the recommendation of Mrs. Damer, whose portrait he
was painting. Mrs. Damer had excused her unpunctuality
at one of her sittings on the ground that she had
become so interested in the fortunes of “Evelina” that
she could not put the book down.</p>

<p>“Get it for yourself, sir,” she had said, “and you will
quickly acknowledge that my excuse is valid.”</p>

<p>“Of course I did not get it then,” said Sir Joshua.
“I find it impossible to keep pace with the useful books
that are printed in these days, and I have long ago given
up novels. But when, the next day, Mrs. Damer came
to sit to me with a woebegone countenance and the traces
of tears on her cheeks, so that I could only paint her
draping, and that, too, had a woeful droop in its folds—for
let me tell you, madam, that a woman’s dress is
usually in sympathy with the mood of the wearer—when,
I say, the lady entered my painting-room in this
guise, I ventured to inquire if she was serious in her wish
that I should depict her in the character of Niobe. ‘Oh,
sir,’ she cried, ‘’tis all due to that horrid Branghton—he
it is that has brought me to this.’ ‘The wretch!’ said
I. ‘Have you no friend who will run him through the
vitals? Where is he to be found, that I may arrange
for his destruction?’ ‘He is the persecutor of my beloved
Evelina,’ she replied, ‘and heaven only knows what
is to become of the poor girl.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now, madam, when I had thus brought before me the
effect that the book had produced upon so natural a lady
as Mrs. Damer, what was left for me but to buy it? And
now you see the effect that it has had upon me,” continued
Sir Joshua, “so you must e’en buy it also.”</p>

<p>“Nay, Sir Joshua,” said Mrs. Burney, “your case has
furnished me with the strongest of reasons for not buying
it. I would not allow a book into my house that
would so turn me aside from my ordinary life and my
daily business. What, sir, would you have me stay out
of my comfortable bed for hours, in order that I might
make myself more uncomfortable still by reading of the
imaginary woes of a young woman who is nothing to me
but a shadow?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I promise you that you will find Evelina far
from being a shadow,” said Sir Joshua. “She is a
creature of flesh and blood, with a heart that beats so
that you find your own heart keeping time with it,
whether it pulsates slowly or fast. In short, Evelina
lives. I have no patience with those attenuated figures
that dance on the stage of so many of our new novel
writers: I can see the stuffing of straw when their constant
gyrating has worked a rip in their seamy side;
creatures of rag and wire—they never deceive one for a
moment—why, their very gyrations are not true to life.
But Evelina lives. Some of the characters in the book
are distasteful—some of them are vulgar, but the world is
made up of distasteful and vulgar people, and a novel
should be true to the world in which the characters are
placed. Oh, that was where the greatness of poor Dr.
Goldsmith was to be found. He would abate nothing of
the vulgarity of the vulgar characters in his plays, because
he meant them to live. The people hissed his vulgar
bailiffs in his <cite>Good-Natured Man</cite>, and when Colman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
cut them out he himself restored them when Shuter
played the piece for his benefit the following year, and
everyone saw that they were true to life. The vulgarity
of Tony Lumpkin and the Three Pigeons made Walpole
shudder, but there they remain in the best comedy of our
time, and there they will remain for ever. Oh, yes; the
author of ‘Evelina’ knows what life is, and so his book
will live.”</p>

<p>“And who is the author of this surprising book?”
asked Mrs. Burney.</p>

<p>“That is a mystery,” replied Reynolds. “I sent to
Lowndes, the bookseller, to inquire, and he pretended
that he did not know. He could only say that he was a
gentleman of note living in Westminster.”</p>

<p>“Ah, that is one of the booksellers’ tricks to make their
wares seem more attractive,” said she. “They know
that a man in a mask awakens curiosity.”</p>

<p>“That is so; but ‘Evelina’ stands in need of no advertisement
of such a nature. It would attract attention
even though the name of Mr. Kenrick were attached to
it. But everyone is dying to find out the name of the
author; Mrs. Damer believes it to have been written by
Horace Walpole, but only because ‘The Castle of Otranto’
was published without his name being on the title
page.”</p>

<p>“Not a very cogent line of argument, it seems to me,”
said Mrs. Burney. “Well, Sir Joshua, I hope you will
enjoy a comfortable sleep to-night, now that you have
the fortunes of that young lady off your mind.”</p>

<p>“Oh, my dear madam, I do assure you that my mind is
not yet free from the effects of reading that book,” cried
Reynolds. “I am more faithful to my friends in some
books than to forget all about them when I lay them on
the shelf. If they live, be assured that I live with them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
and the thought of them is to me at times as pleasant as
the thought of the best friends I have met in my daily
life. I have laid ‘Evelina’ on a shelf in my memory—not
one of the back shelves, but one that is near to me, so
that I can console myself with her companionship when
I am lonely.”</p>

<p>“I have never heard you praise a book so heartily,
sir,” said Mrs. Burney. “But I will beg of you not to
mention it to any of my family, for if it has so unhinged
you, what would it not do to those poor girls?”</p>

<p>He did not catch all she had said, for she spoke in a
voice which she did not mean to travel to Fanny or Susy,
who were chatting to Miss Theophila Palmer, Sir
Joshua’s niece.</p>

<p>“You may depend on my telling them all I find out in
regard to the author,” said he in a tone of assent.</p>

<p>“No, no,” she cried, getting nearer to the bell of
his trumpet. “No, no; I want you to refrain from
mentioning the book to them. I discourage all novel
reading, excepting, of course, the works of Mr. Richardson,
and perhaps one or two of Fielding, with some of
the pages gummed together to prevent them from being
read.”</p>

<p>“Nay, to tempt people to read them,” said Reynolds.
“What were we saying about the attractions of a mask?
Well, my word for it, the attractions of a book without
a name are as nothing compared with the attraction of
gummed pages. But you will let them read ‘Evelina,’
and you will, moreover, read it yourself—yes, and you
will all be the better and not the worse for doing so.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burney shook her head.</p>

<p>It was no wonder that Mrs. Thrale thought that Miss
Burney looked flushed at this time, or that there was an
unwonted sparkle in her eyes; for she had heard nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
every word that Sir Joshua had said, and she could
scarcely contain herself for delight. For all her primness,
she was at heart a merry schoolgirl, ready to
break into a dance at good news, and to shout for joy
when things had advanced as she had hoped they would.
She felt that it was very hard on her that she could
not throw her hat up to the ceiling of the room, as she
had heard of Dr. Goldsmith’s doing with his wig in the
exuberance of his spirits in this same room—when Miss
Reynolds was in her bed upstairs. It was very hard
on her to be compelled to restrain her feelings; she
was unconscious of the sparkle in her eyes, or of the
pæony flush of her cheeks that Mrs. Thrale had noticed
and was still noticing.</p>

<p>She had never felt so happy in all her life. A short
time before she had felt that everything in the world
was insignificant in comparison with love; but now she
realized that there was another joy worthy of recognition.
She was not wise enough to perceive that the two
emotions sprang from the same source—that the foundation
of love is the impulse to create, and that the foundation
of an artist’s joy in fame is the knowledge that
what he has created is recognized by the world. She
was (fortunately) not wise enough to be able to analyse
her feelings—to be wise enough to analyse one’s feelings
is to be incapable of feeling. All that she was conscious
of at that moment was that all worth having in
the world was hers—the instinct to create, which men
call Love, the joy of obtaining recognition for the thing
created, which men call Fame.</p>

<p>It was no wonder that Mrs. Thrale saw that light in
her face and in her eyes; nor was it strange that the
same observant lady should attribute that illumination
to the touch of the fire of the sacred torch. She looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
at the handsome face of the Roman youth, with its expression
of frankness, and at his eyes, full of the
generous warmth of the South, and once more she
glanced at Miss Burney, and saw in her face the reflection
of the southern sunny glow.</p>

<p>“Poor girl—poor girl!” were the words that sprung
to her lips. “Only a moment’s attention from him—only
a word—nay, a glance from those eyes would have
been enough—and she is at his feet. Poor girl! Knowing
nothing of the world—incapable of understanding
anything of life—having no gift to attract attention—”</p>

<p>“Dear Mrs. Thrale, I have come to you for help.
You are sure to have read this book that everyone is
talking about—this ‘Evelina’—and you can, I am certain,
tell us who is the author. Pray let us know if your
friend Dr. Johnson had a finger in it—I have heard
that some of the writing is in the style of Dr. Johnson—or
was it Mr. Anstey—they say that some chapters
could only have come from the author of ‘The Bath
Guide.’”</p>

<p>It was Lady Hales who had hurried up with her inquiries.
She seemed to be the representative of a group
with whom she had been standing, several ladies and
two or three men.</p>

<p>It so happened, however, that Mrs. Thrale had not
yet read the book around which discussion had been
buzzing; but she had no intention of acknowledging
that, with her literary tastes and with her friendship
for Dr. Johnson, she was behind the times. Two or
three people had within the week made remarks about
“Evelina” in her presence, but she had no idea that
it was to become a topic of society.</p>

<p>She smiled enigmatically, to give herself time to make
up her mind what her reply should be—whatever it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
might be, it certainly would not be a confession of ignorance.
She came to the conclusion that on the whole she
could not do better than mould her answer so as to
heighten the mystery of the authorship.</p>

<p>“Is it possible that none of our friends have discovered
the author?” she asked, still smiling shrewdly,
so as to suggest that she herself had long ago been let
into the secret.</p>

<p>“We have had many conjectures,” said Lady Hales.
“And let me whisper in your ear—there is one among
us who is ready to affirm that the address of the author
is Thrale Hall, Streatham.”</p>

<p>“I vow that I am overwhelmed,” cried the little lady.
“The compliment is one that any writer might envy.
Pray how could it enter the mind of any of our friends
to connect me with the authorship of such a book?”</p>

<p>“There are some touches of your style in many of the
letters of Evelina,” replied Lady Hales. “And some
have said that only you could have had the varied experiences
described so vividly.”</p>

<p>“A marvellous book, truly, this ‘Evelina,’” cried Mrs.
Thrale. “Some people, you say, recognize the hand of
Dr. Johnson in its pages, others the pen that wrote ‘The
Bath Guide,’ and now it is suggested that the whole was
the work of a humble scribbler named Mrs. Thrale—a
person who has surely little in common with the two
writers you have named.”</p>

<p>She took care that her affectation of surprise had an
artificial note about it. There was no knowing how
things might turn out. Mrs. Thrale had no objection
in the world to have her name associated with the
authorship of a book about which it was clear a good
many people would be talking for some months to come.</p>

<p>“May I not be entrusted with something more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
definite?” asked Lady Hales in a low voice. “If it is a
secret for the present—well, you know that I am one
to be trusted.”</p>

<p>“I can assure you definitely that the book was not
written by Dr. Johnson,” replied Mrs. Thrale, with a
smile. “He has not for a single week during the past
year failed to visit us at Streatham for at least four
days at a time. He reads to me all that he writes—it
is not much—and I can give you an assurance that the
name of Evelina has not once appeared in his manuscript.
I may also say that if you take my advice you
will not be in too great haste to attribute the book to Mr.
Anstey.”</p>

<p>This was not mystification, it sounded much more like
revelation, Lady Hales thought.</p>

<p>“I dare not press you further, madam,” she said.
“Believe me, I can appreciate your reticence, if—”</p>

<p>“Nay, now you suggest that I have told you a secret
that I have concealed from everyone else, and that is
going too far,” cried Mrs. Thrale. “Now, dear madam,
cannot you see that even if I were in the secret of the
authorship, I should be guilty of a great breach of
courtesy were I to reveal it to anyone? If an author
choose to remain anonymous, is it not discourteous to
try to snatch away his—or her—veil of anonymity?”</p>

<p>“I can but assent,” said Lady Hales. “I do not
doubt that this view of the matter is the correct one.
At any rate, you may depend on my acting in accordance
with it. I shall make no further attempt to pry into the
secret, and I shall think it right to dissuade my friends
from the quest.”</p>

<p>“In that I am sure you will be acting in accordance
with the author’s wishes,” said Mrs. Thrale, smiling
knowingly.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>

<p>So they parted; and Lady Hales hastened back to her
friends to whisper in their ears that the mystery
was as good as solved: Mrs. Thrale had as much as
acknowledged that she was the author of “Evelina,”
but she hoped that, as she had written the book without
the knowledge of her husband, her friends would
respect her desire to remain anonymous.</p>

<p>“Mr. Thrale, being a Member of Parliament, would
not like to have the name of his wife bandied about
among ordinary people as that of the writer of a novel,”
Lady Hales explained, though really no explanation
was needed of a fact that could be appreciated by every
sensible person aware of the contemptible character of
the novels of the day. “Only Dr. Johnson is in the
secret,” she continued. “Dr. Johnson, as we all know,
lives at Thrale Hall for five days out of every week,
finding the table provided by Mrs. Thrale to suit his
palate very much better than that controlled by poor
blind Mrs. Williams at Bolt Court.”</p>

<p>“That may account for some of the touches in the
book in the style of Dr. Johnson,” said one of the
ladies. “You may be sure that no book could be written
under the same roof as Dr. Johnson without his having
something to say to it.”</p>

<p>“I never could understand how so fastidious a lady
as Mrs. Thrale could tolerate the company of Dr. Johnson
at her table, but now the secret is out—this secret
and t’other,” said one of the gentlemen. “Dr. Johnson
is not seen at his best at the dinner-table.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>“So far as that goes, neither is Mr. Thrale himself,”
said another. “He has a huge appetite.”</p>

<p>“I had an inkling all along that Mrs. Thrale wrote
the book,” said a lady with a huge hat. “I actually
remarked to my sister, while I was reading it, ‘if this
story is not written by Mrs. Thrale, Mrs. Thrale is the
one who would like to have written it.’”</p>

<p>“But mind, not a word must be breathed that would
hint that she acknowledged it to me by direct word of
mouth,” cried Lady Hales, beginning to have some
qualms. “No; you must understand clearly that she
did not say in so many words that she wrote it. Indeed,
her last words to me were, that anyone who should
name in public the author of a book published anonymously
would be guilty of a great discourtesy.”</p>

<p>“She is perfectly right: to do so would be to exhibit
very bad taste truly,” came more than one acquiescent
voice.</p>

<p>And the result of their complete agreement on this
point was the immediate dissemination of the report
that Mrs. Thrale was indeed the writer of “Evelina.”</p>

<p>But that clever little lady, on getting rid of the questioner,
found that Signor Rauzzini had slipped away
from her side and was now making his adieux to Mrs.
Burney and her stepdaughters. She noticed that the
light had gone out of Fanny Burney’s eyes as the young
singer bent over her hand, and once again she shook her
head. She had given more attention to Miss Burney
during the previous hour than during all the years she
had visited at St. Martin’s Street. She thought that it
might be her duty to say a word of warning to the
young woman, who could not possibly know anything
about the world or the deceitfulness of Italian vocalists.</p>

<p>Meantime, however, she ordered one of her three footmen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
to tell the coachman to drive to the shop of Lowndes,
the bookseller, and there she purchased a bound copy
of “Evelina,” at nine shillings.</p>

<p>Mrs. Thrale was, of course, well known to Mr.
Lowndes, and seeing her, through the window of his
office, enter his shop, he put his quill behind his ear
and emerged, bowing and smiling.</p>

<p>“How was it that you failed to apprise me that you
had printed ‘Evelina’?” she inquired.</p>

<p>“Is’t possible that you did not receive my advertisement,
madam?” he cried. “Why, I posted it to you
with my own hands even before the book had left the
press, the truth being that I was anxious to get your
opinion respecting it.”</p>

<p>“I never had any advertisement from you about it,”
she replied.</p>

<p>“Oh, I was to blame for not underlining the announcement,
madam,” said he. “I ask your pardon.
How were you to know that it was not one of the usual
novels of the season?—I do not venture to recommend
such to the attention of ladies of superior tastes like
yourself, madam. I shall not forgive myself, rest assured.
But I am punished, in that I have been unable to sell a
second edition by telling my customers how highly it
was esteemed by Mrs. Thrale.”</p>

<p>“You assume that it would be highly esteemed by
me, Mr. Lowndes; but I am not quite sure that you do
not flatter yourself in believing that my judgment would
be the same as that of the public. The poor public!
How can they possibly know whether a book is good or
bad?”</p>

<p>“They cannot, madam; that is why we poor booksellers
must only trust to sell our books on the recommendation
of ladies of taste and judgment. May I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
beg, madam, that you will favour me with your opinion
respecting the merits of ‘Evelina’?”</p>

<p>“It has been so great a success that I fear I shall
not think highly of it. Pray, who is your modest
author?”</p>

<p>“Positively, madam, I am unable to tell you. The
MS. was brought to me with a letter purporting to come
from a Mr. Grafton at the Orange Coffee House, near
the Haymarket, and he desired the secret of its authorship
to be kept close.”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes; to be sure—kept close from the vulgar
public; but he could never think that you were violating
his confidence by telling me his name.”</p>

<p>“He could not be so unreasonable, madam—nay,
rather would he kneel to you—for he could scarce fail
to understand the value that we set on—”</p>

<p>“I am not convinced either that he would benefit
from the exchange of confidence or that I should; but
prithee, sir, what is his name?”</p>

<p>“’Fore heaven, madam, I have told you so much
as is known by me respecting the gentleman. Never
before have I been placed in so remarkable a position.
My fault, Mrs. Thrale, no doubt: I should have taken
precautions against being thus surprised into publishing
a book without knowing the name of the author.
But although my judgment enabled me to perceive that
the work was out of the common, yet I never counted on
its merits being recognized so speedily. May I beg of
you to favour me with your opinion as to who the
writer may be, madam—that is, when you have read it,
unless, indeed—” he glanced at her shrewdly with a
little knowing smile—“unless, indeed, you could so
favour me <em>instanter</em>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>“Nay, Mr. Lowndes, how would it be possible for me
to give you an opinion as to the authorship of a book
which I have not yet read? I am not one of those astute
critics who, they say, can tell you all there is to be known
about a book without cutting the leaves, or even—if you
slip a guinea into their hand—without opening the
covers.”</p>

<p>“I thought that perhaps you might be one of those
who have been let into the secret, madam. I trust
that Dr. Johnson’s health has not been so bad as to prevent
him from doing any literary work. Ah, what does
not that great man—nay, what does not the world owe
to you, Mrs. Thrale?”</p>

<p>“If you would suggest, Mr. Lowndes, that the book
about which we have been conversing was written, even
in part, by Dr. Johnson, I can give you an assurance
that such is not the case. He is in no way inclined to
engage in any form of literary labour. He grudges
his friends even a note.”</p>

<p>“There are some gentlemen who come hither and
honour me by conversing on the subject of letters,
and more than one of them has pointed out passages in
‘Evelina’ that show signs of the great Doctor’s pen; but
for that matter—”</p>

<p>“I agree with you, sir; every scribbler in Grub Street
apes the style of Dr. Johnson, but only to reveal the
ape in himself. Now, Mr. Lowndes, if you really are
in earnest in saying that you are unaware who is the
author of your book, I have done you some service in
curtailing by one the list of authors to whom it might
possibly be attributed. You may strike out the name of
Johnson, sir, on my authority.”</p>

<p>“I shall certainly do so, madam—not that I, for my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
own part, was ever foolish enough to fancy that he had
written more of it than a page or two. I am indebted
to you, Mrs. Thrale.”</p>

<p>“Then if you would wish to pay off the debt, you
can do so by informing me of your success in discovering
the writer. ’Tis quite impossible to conceive
of the man’s remaining unrevealed for any length of
time, and I confess that I am anxious to know if he
is among my acquaintance.”</p>

<p>“You assume the sex, madam.”</p>

<p>“What, have you a doubt of it?”</p>

<p>“There are so many literary ladies nowadays, Mrs.
Thrale.”</p>

<p>“But you surely saw the handwriting of the script?”</p>

<p>“That is just the point. My printers have examined
it and say that it is a lady’s caligraphy only disguised
to look like a man’s. In my own judgment they are
right. It is an upright hand, neat and clear—not in
the least like that of an author. Still, that counts but
little, seeing that the writer of the book would be pretty
certain to have a clear copy made of his script by someone
else. I have had a suspicion, from the mystery insisted
on by this Mr. Grafton, that he is none other than
the author of the ‘Castle of Otranto.’”</p>

<p>“What, Mr. Walpole?”</p>

<p>“Even so. You recollect how delighted he was to
conceal the hand he had in that book—going much
farther than I thought any gentleman would in honour
go, to make people believe it was what it pretended to
be?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Lowndes, I know not what your experience has
been; but mine is that when a gentleman becomes an
author he lays aside whatever sense of honour he possesses
as a gentleman.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>“I have had little to do with gentlemen authors,
madam. Most of my writers are simply authors.”</p>

<p>“And Mr. Walpole very properly put himself in line
with them, and so had no hesitation in carrying out
his fraud in ‘Otranto.’ Well, if it be so, you may
count on his revealing himself now that the book has
become a success. In any case, you will not forget to
keep me informed, and I shall esteem it a favour, Mr.
Lowndes.”</p>

<p>Mr. Lowndes renewed his promise and bowed the
lady to the door. The three volumes of “Evelina” had
been brought out to the chariot by one of the footmen,
a second following in his footsteps to see that he deposited
them fairly upon one of the cushions, and a third
standing by the open door in case of the breakdown
of either of the others.</p>

<p>Mrs. Thrale got into the splendid machine, the three
lackeys swung themselves up on their platform behind,
and clung on to the heavy straps, looking, in their brilliant
livery, as the chariot lurched away over the uneven
cobble-stones, like mighty butterflies of a tropical
forest swaying together on the rim of a gigantic flower.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>

<p>No chance had Rauzzini of saying more than the
most conventional words of farewell to Fanny.
Mrs. Burney was beside her and her two sisters also.
He yielded to his impulse to pronounce a malediction
on Mrs. Thrale, who had so interrupted his conversation
with Fanny—the last he could possibly have until
his return from France after fulfilling his engagements.
But this was when he had seen the Burney family out
of the door of the house in Leicester Fields and to the
entrance to St. Martin’s Street. He was then alone,
and could give in some measure expression to his feelings
in his own tongue.</p>

<p>His imagination was quite vivid enough to suggest to
him all that the officiousness of Mrs. Thrale had interrupted—the
exchange of vows—the whispered assurances
of fidelity—perhaps a passionate kiss—a heaven-sent
chance during a marvellous minute when the painting-room
should be emptied of all but herself and him!
It was distracting to think of all that had been cut out
of his life by that busybody. While he had been talking
alone with Fanny his eyes had taken in the splendid
possibilities of the painting-room. There were three
immense easels on different parts of the floor, and each
carried a glorious canvas for a life-size portrait. Two
of them were already finished, and the third contained
a portion of the Greek altar at which a fair lady was to
be depicted making her oblation to Aphrodite, or perhaps
Artemis. The young man, however, did not give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
a thought to the glowing work of the great painter on
the canvases, he thought only of the possibilities of a
moment or two spent in the protecting shadow of one of
them with that gentle, loving girl yielding herself to his
clasp—only for a moment—he could not reasonably
hope that it should be for longer than a single moment,
but what raptures might not be embraced even within
that brief space! A moment—one immortal moment
worth years of life! That was what he saw awaiting
him in the friendly shade of one of Sir Joshua’s portraits—that
was all that the sublime picture meant to
the ardent lover—it was not the immortal picture, but the
immortal moment that was before his eyes—but just
when, by a little manœuvring on his part, the joy that
should change all his life and console him for being
deprived of the society of his beloved for three months,
was within his reach, that foolish woman had come
bustling up with her chatter and had separated them!</p>

<p>For which he now implored heaven and a heathen
deity or two that still linger in the language of malediction
in their native Italy, to send her soul to the region
where Orpheus had sought his Eurydice. Down—down
with her to the lowest depths of the Inferno he implored
his patrons to bear her and to keep her there for
ever.</p>

<p>His imploration was quite as lyrical as his “Waft her,
Angels, to the Skies,” only its bearing was upon the
fate of the lady in just the opposite direction, and he
was even more fervent in its delivery. But having delivered
it, he felt some of that relief which is experienced
by a true artist who has a consciousness of having done
some measure of justice to his theme. He felt that if
beatitude had been denied to him, the one who had
separated him from it would not escape scathless, if the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
intensity of an appeal to the high gods of his native land
counted for anything in their estimation.</p>

<p>And then he went more or less contentedly to his
lodgings to prepare for his appearance in the opera of
the night.</p>

<p>He sang divinely as an angel, and again if any of his
audience remained unmoved by the enchantment of his
voice, they certainly could not but have yielded to the
charm of his presence. Some women might be incapable
of appreciating the exquisite character of his
vocalism, but none could remain impervious to the appeal
of his smile.</p>

<p>As for the girl who alone had appealed to his heart,
she went home with her mother and sisters without a
word, for she had not perceived the glorious possibilities
lurking behind the grand canvases in Sir Joshua’s painting-room.
She could even bring herself to believe that
the coming of Mrs. Thrale had been rather opportune
than otherwise; for if she had not joined her stepmother
at that time she would not have heard all that Sir
Joshua had said about “Evelina.”</p>

<p>All that she had heard had made her supremely happy,
not, she thought, because she was greedy for fame, but
because it meant to her that she was a step nearer to
the arms of the man she loved. The fame which Sir
Joshua’s words implied was dear to her because she
knew that she need not now hesitate to seat herself by
the side of this king of men, as his equal—no, not quite
as his equal, but certainly not as a beggar maid. She
knew that when it was announced that she was the writer
of a great book, or, what was better still, a book that
everybody was talking about, people would not shrug
their shoulders when they heard that Rauzzini, the
Roman singer, whose name was in everybody’s mouth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
was about to marry her. The event that she scarcely
dared hope for had actually happened: she was no longer
the nobody which she had been, she was a woman the
product of whose brain had been acclaimed by the best
judges, and so the barrier that she had seen separating
her lover from herself had been thrown down. The
same voices that had acclaimed her Rauzzini as a singer
had acclaimed her as a writer; for though she had hesitated
to receive her cousin Edward’s reports from the
libraries as conclusive of the mark that the book was
making, she could not now have any doubt on the subject:
a book that was spoken of by Sir Joshua Reynolds
as he had spoken of “Evelina” must be granted a place
high above the usual volumes to be found on the shelves
of a circulating library. She was convinced that in
a short time everyone would be talking about it in
the same strain, and though people might be incredible
on the subject of its authorship, the fact would remain
the same—she had written the book, and the fame that
attached to the writer would assuredly be hers. There
would now be no sneering references to King Cophetua.
Everyone within their circle would admit that there was
no disparity between her position as the writer of the
book that everyone was talking about and that of the
singer whom people crowded to hear.</p>

<p>She felt supremely happy. Though Mrs. Burney had
not shown any particular wish to repeat what Reynolds
had said to her about the book, she knew perfectly well
that this was only because of her general distrust of
anything in the form of a novel, and her fear lest something
unreadable should get into the hands of the girls.
But Fanny also knew that the fact of Mrs. Burney’s
shunning the novels of the circulating libraries would
not interfere with the reputation that must accrue to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
the author of “Evelina”; so she was not affected by
the indifference shown by her stepmother to all that
Reynolds had said. She awaited without impatience the
day when her father should take up the book and read
the Ode at the beginning. She felt that, although his
name was not at the head, he would know that the verses
were addressed to him, and that it was his daughter
Fanny who had written them. She knew that however
firmly he might assert himself on the side of his wife
in preventing the entrance to the house of all novels
excepting those of Richardson—Fanny herself had never
had a chance of reading even “The Vicar of Wakefield”—he
would be proud of her as the writer of “Evelina.”
She was not quite sure if he would be as proud of her
as if she had developed a wonderful musical capacity;
but she never doubted that his affection for her—assisted
by his knowledge of the impression the book had made
upon the most important of his own associates—would
cause him to take her into his arms with delight and to
forgive her for running the chance of being classed among
the Miss Minifies of the period—the female writers
whose ridiculous productions were hidden beneath the
sofa cushions in so many households. Fanny Burney
was a dutiful daughter and she had nothing of the cynic
about her, but she was well aware of the fact that success
would be regarded by her father as justifying an
experiment that failure would have made discreditable.</p>

<p>Once more, then, the three sisters met that night in
Fanny’s bedroom. The two younger could now look
on her without their feeling of awe. They were on the
verge of being indignant with Mrs. Burney for having
made no reference whatever since returning from the
Reynoldses to the subject of Sir Joshua’s eulogy.</p>

<p>“Not once did she mention the name of ‘Evelina’ to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
the padre; Sir Joshua might just as well have talked of
Miss Hersehel’s comet to her,” said Susy.</p>

<p>“And after our schooling ourselves so rigidly to give
no sign that we were in any measure connected with the
book too—it was cruel!” said Lottie.</p>

<p>“It was not as if the padre did not give her a good
chance more than once,” continued Susy. “Did he not
ask if anyone had given her any news? And what did
she answer?—Why, only that someone had said that Mr.
Fox had lost a fortune a few nights ago at faro! As if
anybody cares about Mr. Fox! I was prepared for her
opening out at once to him about the book—maybe
begging him to send Williams to buy it at Mr.
Lowndes’.”</p>

<p>“What, at seven-and-sixpence!” cried Fanny. “My
dear child, do you know mamma no better than to fancy
that?”</p>

<p>“What I don’t know is how she resisted it,” said
Lottie. “Oh, you heard how Sir Joshua talked about
it; and Miss Reynolds too—she praised it up to the
skies.”</p>

<p>“Other people in the painting-room as well as in
the drawing-room were talking of it,” said Susy. “I
heard the beautiful Miss Horneck speak of it to the
lady with the big muff and the rose taffeta with the forget-me-not
embroidery.”</p>

<p>“I am sure that everybody was speaking of it—I could
hear the name ‘Evelina’ buzzing round the rooms,”
cried Lottie.</p>

<p>“Yes; everyone was talking about it, and only mamma
was silent—<em>is</em> silent. I don’t think that at all fair,”
continued Susy.</p>

<p>Fanny laughed.</p>

<p>“You are silly little geese,” she cried. “Could you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
not see that she would not mention it lest it should
reach our ears and we should be filled with an irresistible
desire to possess it—<em>it</em>—a modern novel! Think of it!
Oh, my dears, you are too unreasonable. Mamma knows
her duty too well to allow even the name of a novel
to pass her lips and maybe reach the ears of such a group
of fly-away young things as ourselves! She understands
the extent of her responsibilities. Go to your beds and
be thankful that you have so excellent a guardian.”</p>

<p>“But when we were prepared—” began one of them,
when Fanny interrupted her.</p>

<p>“You may conserve your preparations—you will hear
her say the name soon enough—you may depend upon
that,” she said. “You may prepare to hear yourselves
summoned into her presence to give a full and true account
of your complicity in the thing which was perpetrated
under this sacred roof—nay, in the very room
where the great philosopher Newton wrote his thesis!
A novel written in the room in which the divine ‘Principia’
was produced! Why, ’twere as bad in mamma’s
eyes as acting one of Mr. Foote’s farces in St. Paul’s
Cathedral. Oh, yes, you’ll have to face her soon enough,
and after that you’ll never wish to hear the name
Evelina again. Now, good-night and thank heaven for
your respite.”</p>

<p>They left her, glum and dissatisfied. It was plain
to her that they were disappointed at not being given
the opportunity of showing how admirably they had
themselves under control in regard to the secret—of
showing Fanny how they could hear Mrs. Burney talk
at length about “Evelina,” while neither of them gave
the least sign of ever having heard the name before.
It was indeed disappointing that all their studied immobility
should go for nothing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>But Fanny knew that their secret could not possibly
remain hidden for many more days. If the book was
going into everybody’s hands, her father would be certain
to have it, and then—would he not know? Would
not she be summoned into his presence and that of his
wife—the lady of many responsibilities—and required
to defend herself?...</p>

<p>She fell asleep before she had come to any conclusion
as to the line of defence that she should adopt.</p>

<p>And in spite of the readiness of her sisters for any
inquisition to which they might be summoned, they were
startled—as was also Fanny herself—when, immediately
after a rather silent and portentous breakfast, Mrs.
Burney said:</p>

<p>“Susy and Lottie, you may go to your duties. You,
Fanny, will remain, as your father wishes to speak to
you on a matter of some gravity.”</p>

<p>So the long-expected hour had come, the three girls
thought. By some accident unknown to them their
secret was exposed, and Fanny was about to be called
upon to explain, if she could, to the satisfaction of her
father and her stepmother, how it came that she so far
forgot the precepts of her upbringing as to write a
novel quite in the modern spirit, though adopting a form
which the master-touch of Mr. Samuel Richardson had
hallowed.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>

<p>The two girls left the room slowly, after sending in
the direction of Fanny a glance which they meant
should encourage her—a glance which should let her
know that they were quite ready to share her punishment,
should the worst come to the worst.</p>

<p>Fanny replied to them with her eyes; and then prepared
for the worst.</p>

<p>It quickly came.</p>

<p>“My dear daughter,” said Dr. Burney, when they
were alone, Mrs. Burney in her chair at the head of the
table. “My dear Fanny, I am no believer in leading
by degrees up to such a communication as I have to
make to you. I think that the sooner it is got over
the better it will be for all whom it may concern.
Well, this is it: Mr. Thomas Barlowe has written to
me asking my permission for him to address you with a
view to marriage.”</p>

<p>He made a pause, looking at her to observe the effect
of this revelation.</p>

<p>And what he saw at first was a girl with a pale face
and downcast eyes, awaiting, almost breathlessly, an
accusation from which she shrank; but when he had
spoken he saw a great change come over her. Not immediately,
but gradually. It seemed to him that she
had not fully realized the meaning of his words—that
she was puzzled—trying to recall what he had said.
Then the light seemed to dawn upon her. She flushed,
and, after a few moments, threw back her head and went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
into a peal of laughter—a real schoolgirl’s fit of laughter
at something amazingly comic—the tumbling of a clown
into a pool of water with a splash, or, perhaps, the
slipping of a dignified beadle upon a butter slide. Her
laughter went on for a long time, but without in the
least suggesting hysteria—it was simply a girl’s natural
laughter on realizing the comic side of a situation which
grown-up people would regard as extremely serious.</p>

<p>Neither her father nor his wife could understand why
she should receive in such a spirit an essentially serious
communication—the most serious that any young
woman could receive. They had not before them the
ludicrous picture that presented itself to her imagination—a
picture of the Roman Rauzzini on the one side
and the Poultry Barlowe on the other, asking her to
choose between them. It was this presentiment, coming
in a flash the moment she realized that the publishing of
the book was not the question which she had to face, that
forced her to yield to that long fit of laughter.</p>

<p>Her father and stepmother sat stolidly by, but she
knew that had she and her father been alone, he would
at least have smiled with her.</p>

<p>In a few minutes she had recovered herself sufficiently
to be able to apologize for her levity.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” she said. “I am behaving like
a goose, but I could not help it—something forced me—something
that occurred to me—a funny thing. I am
very sorry.”</p>

<p>“There is nothing funny that I can see in the honourable
request made by an honest young man, my dear
Fanny,” said Mrs. Burney.</p>

<p>“No, no; nothing whatever; only—well, funny ideas
will occur to foolish people like myself at the most
serious moments,” said Fanny.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>“That is quite true, indeed,” said her father. “I
have myself experienced what you say. Perhaps, after
all, I should not have blurted out what I had to tell
you—it came to you as a surprise, I doubt not.”</p>

<p>“A great surprise, indeed,” she replied. “I cannot
understand how Mr. Barlowe could ever fancy that I—that
he—that—oh, I should have known what that terrible
entertainment was meant to lead to—but when, in that
clumsily marked way I was sent into the drawing-room
with him alone, he began to talk of his uncle, the Alderman—he
said that the Alderman was quite approachable
even in regard to ordinary people like ourselves—and
then came his cousins—all of them remarkable! But
you should have seen him slice away at the ham—the
biggest ham I ever saw—it needed to be—such eating!”</p>

<p>“The recollection of that no doubt made you laugh,”
said Dr. Burney. “But, at the same time, you must
remember that though the customs of the Poultry are not
ours, still, they may be very reasonable customs—perhaps
more reasonable than our own. It may suit us to
dine as late as half-past four and only to have a slice of
cake with our tea; but business people find it more convenient
to dine at one o’clock—it makes an equal division
of their long working-day—so that a slice of ham—”</p>

<p>“I know that is quite true, and I was not so foolish
as to give myself airs because I had dined at half-past
four and had no appetite for ham,” said Fanny; “but—oh,
mother, you saw how foolishly formal was the
whole thing.”</p>

<p>“I said that I thought it quite unnecessarily formal,”
replied Mrs. Burney, “and if I had had any notion that
it was going to be like that I would certainly have
given Mrs. Barlowe a hint. Still, Thomas is, I know,
an excellent young man who has never given his parents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
an hour’s uneasiness, and his intentions are honourable,
and so should be honoured. If you have no tender
regard for him at present that is no reason why, when
you get accustomed to the thought of him as a suitor
for your hand—”</p>

<p>“Oh, mother, that is quite impossible!” cried Fanny.
“How could I ever get accustomed to such a
thought?”</p>

<p>“I do not know why you should not,” replied Mrs.
Burney. “He is a most worthy young man, and Mr.
Barlowe’s business is one of the best in the City. You
must remember, my dear Fanny, that in these days a
girl, unless she has a portion, runs a very great chance
of becoming an old maid, so that no opportunity of
settling down in a comfortable home should be
neglected.”</p>

<p>“That is perfectly true,” said Dr. Burney. “You
will understand that we have no desire to force this
or any match upon you, my dear child: so long as I have
a house over my head you shall share it. But I am
sure that you must know that I am a poor man to-day,
although I have worked as hard at my profession as any
living man, and I cannot provide you or your sisters
with any portion. Heaven knows that if I had a fortune
I would gladly divide it among you; but as it is, I think
it right to tell you that you need expect nothing.”</p>

<p>“Dearest father,” said Fanny, dissolving into tears,
as she took his hand and kissed it, “I have never expected
a fortune from you—not a penny piece. I know
that I shall be portionless, and I daresay that Mr. Barlowe
thinks himself generous in his proposal; but I could
never bring myself to accept him—to look on him as a
suitor. It would be quite impossible. If I thought it
possible that I should ever have any affection for him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
I might feel myself justified in encouraging him; but
I know that it would be out of the question. I would
prefer to go forth and beg my bread—nay, to starve.”</p>

<p>“Then we shall pursue the matter no farther for the
present,” said her father, kissing her on the forehead as
she nestled close to him.</p>

<p>“Yes, that is best—for the present,” acquiesced his
wife. “Still, if you will be advised by me, my dear
Fanny, you will remember that Mr. Barlowe is ready to
address you knowing that you will be portionless, and
if you bear that in mind, perhaps you will be surprised
to find some day, not so far distant, that the thought
of him is not so repugnant to you. You are no longer
a girl, and when one is midway between twenty and
thirty every extra year counts in reducing one’s chances
of being settled in life. I could cite dozens of instances
that I have known of young women being glad to accept
at twenty-eight the suitors they scorned at twenty or
twenty-five. Oh, yes, the years come upon one and
bring with them a clearer vision of life and love; frequently
they bring regret for opportunities neglected.
But we will not press the matter any farther—just now.
I dare say the young man will submit to be put off—for
a time.”</p>

<p>“Nay, for ever,” said Fanny resolutely.</p>

<p>“Oh, well,” said her stepmother.</p>

<p>After a pause, during which Fanny seemed to be debating
some matter in her mind, a little line showing
itself along her forehead, she said slowly:</p>

<p>“I do not think that I shall be a burden on you, dear
father; I believe that one day I may be able to do something.”</p>

<p>“Do not fancy that I would ever think of you as a
burden, my dear child,” said her father. “But what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
do you mean by saying that you may one day do something?—some
work, do you suggest?”</p>

<p>“Something—I am fond of writing,” she murmured.</p>

<p>He laughed gently, saying:</p>

<p>“You are a very good girl, my love, and I know how
much I am indebted to you for your admirable copying
of my notes for the History; but do not let the idea
take hold of you that such work is well paid. If you
ever get in touch with a bookseller, he will tell you that
the work of a copyist is very poorly paid.”</p>

<p>“I was not thinking of copying,” murmured Fanny.</p>

<p>“Of what then, pray?” he asked.</p>

<p>“If I could but write a book,” she replied, with her
eyes on the floor.</p>

<p>“A book!” cried Mrs. Burney, who thought that she
had been silent long enough. “A book!”</p>

<p>“To be sure—to be sure,” said her father, in the indulgent
tone of a parent humouring a child. “You
might write a book—so might anyone who could pay
for a ream of paper, a bottle of ink and a box of quills.
You should speak to Mr. Newbery about it: he has
printed many nursery stories since ‘Goody Two Shoes.’
You might indeed do something that the children would
take a fancy to. Well, Francis Newbery is as honest a
man as his uncle, and we may talk to him about it. By
the by, did not you once tell me that you had written
something, or that you were going to write something?
You thought it proper to get my leave. I had forgotten
that. Well, if it be a moral nursery story, we might
interest Mr. Newbery in it.”</p>

<p>“I do not think that it is quite wise to encourage a
girl to neglect her useful household duties in order to
compile some rubbish that no one would read,” said
Mrs. Burney.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>“Of course you will understand that you are not to
neglect your household duties, Fanny,” said her father.</p>

<p>“If she performs her household duties and sticks to
her needlework, she will have no time left for scribbling
rubbish,” cried Mrs. Burney, hastily. “She made a
bonfire of all that childish nonsense long ago, and I hope
that she will never be so foolish as to waste good paper
and pens and, most precious of all, good time, over such
exercises. That is all we have to say just now, I think—is
it not, Doctor? I shall reply to Mr. Barlowe’s
letter—a most creditable letter—straightforward—honourable!
I am only sorry that I cannot make the reply
to it that it deserves.”</p>

<p>She had opened the door and called for William, their
manservant, to remove the breakfast things. Fanny
lingered for a few minutes after she had risen from her
chair. She had assumed from the moment she had begun
to speak of writing, that her opportunity had come;
if her stepmother had not interposed so hastily and so
emphatically, she would have made her confession as to
“Evelina,” let the consequences be what they might;
but now that the servant had come with his tray and her
stepmother jingled her key-basket, she perceived that
her chance was gone. She had a sense of sneaking out
of the room.</p>

<p>As she went slowly up the stairs she could hear the
voice of her stepmother remonstrating with her father
for having said something that she, Fanny, might regard
as encouragement to waste her precious time in the pursuit
of such folly as writing a book.</p>

<p>She heard her father’s little laugh as he explained
(she was sure) that of course he had not been speaking
seriously; but that he had not the heart to be severe
upon her and her harmless scribbling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>The author of “Evelina” went very slowly upstairs,
and when she reached the work-room landing she found
Susy and Lottie waiting for her, glowing with excitement.
Susy was waving over her head what seemed to
be a bulky pamphlet. Coming closer, Fanny saw that it
was the chief of the literary reviews, which had apparently
just arrived at the house.</p>

<p>“A splendid column about ‘Evelina,’” she whispered.
“Not so good as it should be, but still splendid. Here
it is. But why are you so glum? Surely they did not
scold you now that the book is so great a success.”</p>

<p>“They did not ask me to tarry in the room to charge
me with double-dealing in regard to the book,” said
Fanny. “They would not allow me to make my confession
when I had the opportunity—the best that I
shall ever have. ’Twas not my confession that was
on the <i lang="fr">tapis</i>, but quite another. That is why I look
glum.”</p>

<p>“Another—another confession? But what had either
of them to confess?” cried Lottie.</p>

<p>“Nothing. They didn’t confess.”</p>

<p>“But whose confession was it, then, if not theirs?”
asked Lottie.</p>

<p>“It was young Mr. Barlowe’s,” said Fanny, with a
lugubriousness that was quite comic. “Young Mr. Barlowe
wrote to the padre to confess that he was passionately—madly—in
love with me, and threatening to
drown himself unless permission were given to him to
address me—we all know how fervently young Mr. Barlowe
would put his case—that was what I was summoned
to listen to—the fiery letter—only it was too ardent for
my ears: I was only told its purport.”</p>

<p>“But who would ever have thought that he had it in
him?” cried Susy. “Such impudence! I never dreamt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
that he could rise to such a height of impudence or I
should have thought better of him.”</p>

<p>“’Tis not too late yet, my child,” said Fanny. “You
are at liberty to think as highly of Thomas as you please—or
as it would please him. Please take over his
blighted affections and it will be a weight off my mind.
Now give me a chance of reading my splendid review—not
that I care in the least what these foolish critics
may say of me—I care nothing, I tell you, only if you
do not let me see it at once I shall die at your feet.”</p>

<p>“There it is,” said Susy, “a full column! The idea
of anyone written of in such terms being proposed to
by Thomas Barlowe! Such impudence indeed!”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX</h2>

<p>The levity shown by Fanny Burney and the flippancy
of her phrases did not wholly conceal from
her sisters all that she was feeling on the subject of the
proposal to which she had referred with such lightness.
She knew that while her father and her stepmother
would not treat her with any marked disfavour on
account of her rejection of the worthy young man
who was ready to offer her a home, still Mrs. Burney
at least regarded with great disfavour the nature of the
answer which she had to send to the Poultry, and Fanny
was very well aware of the ease with which so conscientious
a guardian as Mrs. Burney could make her
feel every day of her life what was Mrs. Burney’s
opinion of her rejection of an eligible young man.</p>

<p>Fanny recognized the great merits of her stepmother,
and she could look from her standpoint at most of the
incidents of their daily life. In that household one
mouth less to feed was worth consideration—the number
of mouths to feed was a constant source of thought with
Mrs. Burney, as was also the question of a provision for
the future of all of them.</p>

<p>Mrs. Burney would be fully justified in feeling cross
with her, not being aware of the fact that another young
man, compared with whom Thomas Barlowe was as the
dust of the ground, was burning, with an ardour of which
Thomas was incapable, to take her to himself and provide
for her in a style undreamt of in the Poultry.</p>

<p>But the worst of the matter was that she could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
let her stepmother into this secret. She could not say
that she was engaged to marry Signor Rauzzini, and she
might leave herself open to the gravest rebuke for having
listened to his protestations of devotion without
obtaining the consent of either of her parents.</p>

<p>And through all this tangle of reflections there ran
the silken thread of consciousness that she was no longer
the Fanny Burney who was regarded by her stepmother
as the dunce, but Fanny Burney the writer of
“Evelina,” to whom the most critical review had devoted
a full column of adulation!</p>

<p>That was what made her position so anomalous; and
it was because she took the happenings of the previous
days to heart that she went to bed with a shocking headache,
and after a sleepless night was found on the verge
of a fever. She was suffering from suppressed secrets;
but the doctor did not know this. He prescribed James’s
Powders; and when these should have done all that they
were meant to do—a small part of all that Dr. James
and Mr. Newbery affirmed they would do—a change into
the country.</p>

<p>But several weeks had passed before she was strong
enough to start on the latter and most essential portion
of the prescription, and found herself in her own room
in Mr. Crisp’s isolated house at Chessington.</p>

<p>Meantime, of course, she had no further news of the
book, and she remained unconfessed, so far as the secret
of its publication was concerned. Her sisters did not so
much as mention its name or the name of Thomas Barlowe,
so cleverly had they diagnosed the nature of her
malady and so tactfully did they try to hasten her
recovery.</p>

<p>Her old friend Mr. Crisp had been her guide since
her childhood. She always alluded to him as her second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
Daddy—so far as paternal influence was concerned she
might have given him the foremost place. He it was
who had led her on to embody in letters to him the daily
incidents of her life, thus unconsciously setting the loom,
as it were, in which “Evelina” was to be woven. He it
was who became her teacher and her critic, and it was
possibly because she feared his criticism of her work
that she refrained from making a confidant of him from
the first. She felt that she could face the public and the
reviewers—it did not matter how they might receive the
book, but she was too timid to submit it to the mature
judgment of the man who had first put a pen in her
hand. It was not on her own account that she refrained
from giving him a chance of reading her book, but on his:
she knew how hurt he would be if he found her book to
be an indifferent one, and whether indifferent or not,
how angry he would be if people did not buy it by the
thousand.</p>

<p>Now, however, that she found herself alone with him,
she made up her mind to tell him all about it. She
would choose her own time for doing this; but it would
certainly be done before she returned to St. Martin’s
Street.</p>

<p>But on the second day after her arrival at Chessington
a parcel came for her, addressed by Susy. On opening
it, she found it to contain two volumes of “Evelina.”
The letter that was enclosed told her that Cousin Edward
had called at the Orange Coffee House and found that a
set had been left there at the instance of Mr. Lowndes,
addressed to Mr. Grafton. Of these, Lottie had read
the first two, which were now sent on to the author, but
the third she had not finished, and hoped that Fanny
would not mind her detaining it for a few days longer.</p>

<p>This was really the first glimpse that the author had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
of her book in its binding. She had, in the name of Mr.
Grafton, requested Mr. Lowndes to send a set of the
volumes to the Orange Coffee House. But that was
nearly three months ago, and until now Mr. Lowndes
appeared not to have thought it worth his while to comply
with the request. Now, however, it seemed to have
occurred to him that the author of a book that everyone
was talking about might be worth conciliating, and so he
had directed a set of volumes to the Coffee House.</p>

<p>At once Fanny made up her mind that she would
pave the way, so to speak, for a full confession to Mr.
Crisp.</p>

<p>“Susy has sent me on two volumes of a new novel, lest
I should feel dull,” she said. “As if I am not much
more likely to feel dull in the company of a new novel
than of my old Daddy!”</p>

<p>“I thought that your stepmother prohibited the reading
of novels, new or old, in your house,” said he.</p>

<p>“Perhaps mamma did not know anything about this
particular one,” replied Fanny; “besides, it is to be
read in your house, not ours.”</p>

<p>“So that the responsibility will be mine?” said he.
“Mrs. Burney is only answerable to heaven for keeping
your mind free from the baleful influence of novels, but
I am in a worse case, for I am answerable to Mrs. Burney.
And what is the name of the precious production?”</p>

<p>“Let me see,” said Fanny, artfully referring to the
title page. “Oh, yes: ‘Evelina; or, a Young Lady’s
Entrance into the World.’ Do you call that an alluring
title?”</p>

<p>“Too sentimental by half,” he replied. “But I have
heard of the thing, and one of the reviews dealt with it
some weeks ago.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>“Praise or blame?”</p>

<p>“Oh, foolish adulation for the great part; but not
without a reasonable word here and there.”</p>

<p>“The reasonable part you are sure must be the censorious?
That is not fair to the poor author.”</p>

<p>“Poor author? Yes, they are all poor authors nowadays.
What’s the name of this particular item of
poverty?”</p>

<p>“There is no name on the title page; but I hear that
the writer was Mr. Anstey himself.”</p>

<p>“What! another ‘Bath Guide’!”</p>

<p>“Sir Joshua Reynolds told mamma that he had remained
up all night reading it.”</p>

<p>“Poor Sir Joshua! His eyes are none too good at the
best! And does Susy believe that the book which kept
Sir Joshua awake is the best one to send you asleep?
You came to Chessington, you know, to get as much as
possible; ‘Tired Nature’s sweet restorer, balmy sleep!’
the truest words that Shakespeare ever writ.”</p>

<p>“What I propose to do is to try it upon you, my dear
sir. I mean to give you a dose of it this evening, instead
of gruel, and if it makes you sleep I will know that I may
continue it for myself—it will be more wholesome than
poppy or mandragora.”</p>

<p>“Good! But I dare swear that it will be bad enough
to keep me awake. You know that extremes meet in
the case of books, as well as other matters; one keeps
awake reading a good book, in expectancy of its undeveloped
goodness; and reading a bad one, wondering
how far the author can actually go in point of dullness.”</p>

<p>“I have often thought that; but Susy has sent only
two of the three volumes.”</p>

<p>“So that we shall not be able to fathom the full depth
of the author’s dullness? We should be grateful to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
Susy—so should the author. Well, you shall begin after
tea, while there is yet daylight: <i lang="fr">Le livre ne vaut pas la
chandelle</i>.”</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr">Nous verrons</i>,” cried Fanny.</p>

<p>And she started reading the book that same day, an
hour before sunset. The room in which they sat was a
small one with a window facing the west and overlooking
a long stretch of billowy common. The spicy scent of
the wallflowers in the little garden patch at the side of
the house was wafted through the half-open lattice, and
occasionally there came the sound of the ducks gabbling
at the pool beyond the gate that shut off the house from
the lane. It was a cloudless evening, and the sunset
promised to be peach-like in its tender tints of pink and
saffron with the curves of delicate green in the higher
sky. Fanny sat at the window and the old man reclined
at his ease upon the sofa.</p>

<p>“I am giving myself every chance,” he said. “All
that I ask of you, my Fannikin, is that you do not glance
at me every now and again to see if I am still awake. If
you do so, I shall never yield to so much as a doze.”</p>

<p>“I promise faithfully to await your signal that you
are alert,” said she.</p>

<p>And so began one of the most delightful hours of her
life.</p>

<p>She was not a particularly good reader aloud when a
book was casually put into her hands, but here she had
before her a volume that she could almost have repeated
verbatim, so that she soon found that she was just too
fluent: she felt that if she went on at this rate his critical
ear would tell him that she had every page by heart,
and he would ask her for an explanation of so singular
a thing as her being able to repeat so much of a book
which she professed to have in her hands for the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
time. She put a check upon her fluency, and though
she did not go so far as to simulate stumbling over certain
words, she neglected the punctuation now and again,
and then went back upon some of the passages, causing
him to give a little grumble and say:</p>

<p>“Be careful, my dear; there’s no need for haste: the
evening is still young.”</p>

<p>After that she was more careful—which is the same
as saying she was more careless of adhering to the
scheme she had adopted. She felt that as he had now
been put off the scent, she might run along as she pleased
without there being a chance of his suspecting anything
through her showing herself familiar with passage after
passage.</p>

<p>Before she had got through more than a dozen pages
she heard a creaking of the sofa—she trusted herself to
glance in that direction and found that he was no longer
reclining: he was sitting up and listening attentively.
She continued reading without making a remark for a
full hour. The sun had set, but the twilight was clear
enough to allow of her seeing the print on the page
before her for some time still; then the darkness seemed
to fall all at once, and she laid the book down when she
had come to the close of one of the letters.</p>

<p>“Candles,” he said. “Candles! Upon my word, the
world is right for once: the stuff is good. We must have
candles. Candles, I say!”</p>

<p>“Supper, say I,” cried Fanny. “I feel that I have
need of bodily refreshment after such a task. Does it
sound real to you, Daddy Crisp—all about the Young
Lady who is about to enter the world?”</p>

<p>“Not merely does it sound real, it is real—it is reality,”
he replied quickly. “The man who wrote what
you have read has something of the genius of—of—now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
whom does he resemble, think you?—Richardson here
and there, and in places, Fielding, it seems to me.”</p>

<p>“You suppose that ’tis written by a man?” she said.</p>

<p>“Why, of course, ’tis the work of a man,” he replied.
“Where is the woman living that is capable of writing a
single page of that book? What, have I gone to so much
trouble in training you to understand what is bad and
what is good in writing, to so little purpose, that you
should have a doubt as to the sex of what you have just
heard?”</p>

<p>“The sex of a book—a novel?”</p>

<p>“Why not? There are masculine books and there is
feminine—trash. There you have the difference.”</p>

<p>“And you do not consider this to be—trash?”</p>

<p>“Will you get the candles, Miss Burney? It seems
that you are sorely in need of illumination if you put
that question to me seriously. Trash? Madam, you
perceive that I am all eagerness to hear the rest of the
story, and yet you put that silly question to me! Look
you here, you rogue, cannot you see that the very fact
of your putting such a question to me shows that the
book is the work of a man? When a carefully trained
woman such as you cannot yet discriminate between the
good and the trash that is written, how would it be possible
for a woman to write what you have read?”</p>

<p>“You think there is nothing womanly in the book?”</p>

<p>“There is nothing effeminate in the writing, so much
is sure. There is plenty that is womanly in the book,
because the man who wrote it knows how to convey to a
reader a sense of womanliness to be in keeping with the
character of the letters—that is what is meant by genius.
A woman trying to produce the same effect would show
the frill of her petticoat on every page. She would make
the men’s parts in the book as feminine as the women’s.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
Now, no more chatter an you please, but get the
candles.”</p>

<p>“And Mrs. Hamilton will get our supper by their
light.”</p>

<p>Fanny tripped away, and was behind the door of the
larder before she allowed the laughter which was pent
up very close to her eyes to have its freedom. It was a
very hearty laugh that she had, for there was a constant
buzzing in her ears of the question:</p>

<p>“What will he say when he learns the truth?”</p>

<p>She was ready to dance her Nancy Dawson in delight
at seeing the effect of the book upon the old man whom
she loved—the man who was directly responsible for its
existence. If Mr. Crisp had not taken trouble with her,
encouraging her to write her letters to him in a natural
style, the correspondence in “Evelina” would, she knew,
be very different from what it was. So, after all, she
reflected, he was right in pronouncing the book the work
of a man; but he had no idea that he was the man who
was responsible for it. That reflection of hers was as
fully imbued with the true spirit of comedy as her anticipation
of the effect that would be produced upon him
by the revelation of the authorship.</p>

<p>And that was why this young student of the human
comedy was able to restrain herself from making the
revelation to him at once: she had, as it were, a delicate
palate for comedy, and it was a delight to her—the gratification
of her natural vanity had nothing to do with it—to
lead him on to commit himself more deeply every
moment on the question of the sex of the writer. Oh, no;
she had no idea of making any confession to him for the
present. She would have many another chat with him
before the moment for that <i lang="fr">dénouement</i> in the comedy
should arrive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>So she got the candles and the housekeeper laid the
cold chicken and the plates on the supper-table, and Mr.
Crisp set about mixing the salad in the manner he had
acquired in Italy. And all the time they were engaged
over the simple meal he was criticising what she had
read, and he had scarcely a word to say about it that was
not favourable. But he took care to protect himself in
case he should be forced to retire from the position he
had taken up.</p>

<p>“A man is a fool to pronounce an opinion on a book
before he has had the last page read to him,” he
said. “I have only been touching upon the part that
I have heard, and I say that it seems to me to be as good
as anything I have read for years; but that is not saying
that the remainder, or some portions of the remainder,
may not be so greatly inferior as to compel me to pronounce
unfavourably of the book as a whole. I have had
instances of such inequality shown by many writers, and
it may be that the writer of ‘Evelina’ will be added to
the list, although he shows no sign of falling off up to
your last page. Do not be hurried by me, my dear, but
if you have indeed made up your mind to eat no cheese,
Mrs. Hamilton can remove the <i lang="fr">débris</i>, and unless you are
tired, you will read me a few pages more.”</p>

<p>She read until midnight. The only pauses that she
made were when he trimmed the wicks of the candles.
He commended her fluency. She had never read better
in his hearing, he said. She showed that she understood
what she was reading; and that, after all, was the greatest
praise that could be given to anyone. He did not
suggest the likelihood that she was tired.</p>

<p>There was the sound of the bleating of lambs occasionally
borne from the meadows beyond the little stream—the
sound of an owl that came nightly about the house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
from the barn of the farm a few hundred yards away—the
sound of a large moth bumping against the glass of
the casement through which the candle-light shone.
There was nothing to interrupt her in her delightful task
until the church clock struck the hour of midnight.</p>

<p>“Not another line,” she cried, jumping from her
chair. “Poor Evelina! she will be the better for a sleep.
When she awakens she may be able to see more clearly
who are her true friends and who are not to be trusted.
Good-night, dear Daddy; and receive my thanks for your
attention.”</p>

<p>“Give me the volume,” he said. “I usually awake
before six, and so shall have a couple of hours of it before
rising.”</p>

<p>“You will not get it from me, sir,” she cried. “Captain
Mervain knows the naval rule about drinking glass
for glass, and let me tell you that the same rule holds in
the matter of reading a book—chapter for chapter between
us, sir; we shall finish as we have begun.”</p>

<p>She blew him a kiss and ran upstairs to escape his
protests: he shouted them after her from the foot of the
stairs.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>

<p>The next morning was a lovely one, and Fanny was
feeding the ducks in the brook before eight o’clock.
When she came into the house to breakfast she found Mr.
Crisp in the porch.</p>

<p>“You have given me a sleepless night,” he said. “I
lay awake endeavouring to determine for my own satisfaction
what would be the outcome of the girl’s meeting
that dreadful Branghton family. I worked out the story
to its proper conclusion—so I thought—on my left side;
but when I turned on my right I found that I had been
grossly astray in all my fancies; and forthwith I set to
work to put myself right. After an hour or two I
thought I had succeeded, but, lo! a turn on my back and
I saw that, as I planned it, the story would never come
to an end. So I kept on until the dawn. Then I fell
asleep, but only to find myself surrounded by demons,
in the form of Branghtons, and a master devil wearing
the epaulets of a naval officer, and he made for me with
a horrid leer and a cry of Mervain! I awoke in a worse
state than did the Duke of Clarence in the play, and I
have not slept since. Oh, that little mischief, Susy!
Wherefore did she send hither that magic book to be my
undoing?”</p>

<p>“Ah, sir, never before did I perceive the evil of novel
reading,” she said. “I could not understand my
mother’s banning all such books, but now I see the wisdom
of it. I now see how they tend to unsettle one.
But it may not yet be too late to save you from the evil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
influence of ‘Evelina.’ If I read no more of her story,
you will soon forget her and all may be well.”</p>

<p>“You will read no more? Good! Carry out your
threat and I will e’en take the coach to London and buy
a full set at Mr. Newbery’s.”</p>

<p>“At Mr. Newbery’s? Ah, sir, that is a threat you
could not carry out, however vindictive you might be.”</p>

<p>“And why not, prithee? Think you I would begrudge
the seven or eight shillings it would cost?”</p>

<p>“Nay, sir; but if you went to Mr. Newbery you would
probably find yourself treated badly by him if you
accused him of publishing the book. ’Tis Mr. Lowndes
who is the guilty person.”</p>

<p>“You will not put one to the humiliation of a journey
to London all for a trumpery novel?”</p>

<p>“Nay, not for a trumpery novel; but we were talking
of ‘Evelina.’”</p>

<p>“I submit to the correction, my dear; and so now we
are in perfect agreement, you will continue the story, if
only to allay my sleepless speculations.”</p>

<p>“I wonder how it will sound when read in the morning?
I fear that it will be as dull as a play would seem
in the garish light of day.”</p>

<p>“Tell not that to me. There are novels of the morn
as well as of the even, and I believe that the freshness of
this one will be best appreciated in the brightness of
such a morning as this. At any rate, we can but make
a trial of it. If we find that it does not read well, you
can lay it aside till the evening.”</p>

<p>Fanny was delighted to find that he was as interested
in her book as Susy had been; and the noon came and
found her beginning the second volume to him, sitting by
his side in the sunlight that bathed the little garden, and
his attention never flagged. Once or twice, however, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
grumbled, but her ear assured her that his grumble was
not a critical one; it was only meant to censure the
behaviour of the rude Captain Mervain.</p>

<p>They were still in the garden when, shortly after noon,
a chaise was heard in the lane: it appeared to be on its
way to the house.</p>

<p>“What! as I live ’tis mamma and my sisters come to
pay us a visit,” cried Fanny, seeing a handkerchief
waved to her from the window.</p>

<p>“They shall be made welcome, for I cannot doubt that
they have brought the third volume with them,” said
Mr. Crisp, rising to receive his visitors.</p>

<p>In this way the reading was interrupted, and indeed
Fanny was rather glad of a respite. She had not risen
from her chair since nine o’clock. A chance of stretching
her limbs was very acceptable.</p>

<p>Mrs. Burney and the girls had scarcely settled down
to their cakes and sweet wine, after explaining that Dr.
Burney had insisted on their taking this drive into the
country, the day promised to be so fine, when Mr. Crisp
turned to Susy, saying:</p>

<p>“You wicked girl! What did you mean by sending
us the two volumes of that vile novel to upset us poor
country folk? And I hope you have not neglected to
bring with you the third.”</p>

<p>Poor Susy reddened and glanced at Fanny without
trying to make any reply.</p>

<p>“Eh, what is this?” cried the old man. “Do you
mean to disclaim all responsibility for the act? Ah, ’tis
too late for you to make such an attempt. The evil has
been done. The poison has begun to work in our blood;
and its effects can only be neutralized by the contents
of the third volume. Say at once, I pray, if you have
brought it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<p>“Do not trouble poor Susy with your tropes, sir,”
said Fanny. “She cannot grasp your meaning, and
only trusts that we have not gone mad. I suppose that
the road was as usual—half of it muddy and the rest
dusty?”</p>

<p>“I insist on hearing if the third volume is in the
chaise,” said Mr. Crisp, firmly. “If it be not, then you
may drive straight back to St. Martin’s Street and
return hither with it in time for Fannikin to read it
to-night.”</p>

<p>“Pray what book is it that you refer to, Mr. Crisp?”
inquired Mrs. Burney.</p>

<p>“What book, madam! As if there were more books
than one printed this year! Why, Mrs. Burney, where
have you been living all this time, that you have never
heard of ‘Evelina’?” cried he.</p>

<p>“I have heard of little else save this ‘Evelina’ for
some time past; but I have no time for reading novels,
nor has any member of my family,” replied the lady.</p>

<p>“I insisted on one member of your family finding the
time yesterday and to-day, and the consequence is that
she has gone through the first volume and part of the
second since Susy was so obliging as to send them hither.
I was in hopes that you had brought the third volume;
but I perceive that we shall have to wait for it now.”</p>

<p>Susy was examining very closely the pattern on her
plate when Mrs. Burney turned to her, saying:</p>

<p>“Does Mr. Crisp mean that you got that novel and
sent it hither to Fanny?”</p>

<p>“Only part of it—no more than two volumes,” said
Susy quickly, as though anxious to submit extenuating
circumstances to the notice of her stepmother.</p>

<p>“Did you get it at Hill’s library, or where?” inquired
Mrs. Burney.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>“I did not get it at a library,” replied Susy slowly,
as a reluctant witness might answer an incriminating
question.</p>

<p>“What, did you buy it? Did you spend your money
on it?” cried Mrs. Burney, with a note of amazement not
free from anxiety.</p>

<p>“Oh, no; I did not buy it,” said Susy.</p>

<p>“How did it come into your hands, then—tell me
that?”</p>

<p>“Cousin Edward brought it for Fanny.”</p>

<p>“And you read the first two volumes and are now
reading the third?”</p>

<p>“Nay, mamma, ’tis I that was led by my curiosity,”
said Lottie hastily.</p>

<p>“Though you have often heard me protest against the
vice of novel reading? I wonder at you, Lottie. I am
shocked that you should so yield to a vulgar temptation,”
said Mrs. Burney.</p>

<p>“Nay, my dear madam, you must not talk of our
dear ‘Evelina’ as if she were an everyday person,” said
Mr. Crisp. “On the contrary, she is a most interesting
young lady, and if I do not soon learn what happens to
her now that she has formed some very dubious intimacies,
I shall be inconsolable. Have you read the book,
Mrs. Burney?”</p>

<p>“Not I indeed,” replied Mrs. Burney, with more than
a suggestion of indignation that such a charge should be
brought against her. “I have heard enough about that
book during the past month to prevent me from having
any wish to read it, even if I were a novel reader, which
I certainly deny. I am ashamed that any member of my
household should so far forget her duty as to read such
stuff.”</p>

<p>“Come, come, my dear lady, you must remember that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
there are novels and novels,” said Mr. Crisp. “I have
heard you praise Mr. Richardson, have I not?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Richardson was a genius and a great moral
writer, sir, as well.”</p>

<p>“The two are not invariably associated. But what if
I tell you that this new book is worthy of being placed
between ‘Clarissa Harlowe’ and ‘Pamela’?”</p>

<p>“You will not do so gross an injustice to the memory
of a great man, I am sure. But, if you please, we will
discuss this no longer. No matter what this ‘Evelina’
may be, the fact remains that I gave a command that
our home should be free from the taint of novel reading,
and my wishes have been secretly ignored. I should not
wonder if Fanny had encouraged Edward to procure the
book for her.”</p>

<p>“I cannot deny it,” said Fanny in a low voice.
“’Twas my doing altogether. All the blame should
rest on my shoulders—yes, from the first—the very first—from
the title page on to ‘Finis.’”</p>

<p>“And your delinquency has given me greater pleasure
than I have derived from other people’s rectitude,” said
Mr. Crisp. Then he turned to Mrs. Burney.</p>

<p>“Dear madam, you must forgive our Fannikin for
her misdemeanour. If you had but read the book for
yourself you would feel as I do on the subject. ’Tis the
most fascinating story—”</p>

<p>“That is, I hold, the worst of the matter,” said Mrs.
Burney. “The more fascinating the novel, the more
dangerous it is, and the greater reason there is why it
should be excluded from every honest home. A dull
story may do but little harm. One might reasonably
tolerate it even among a household of young girls, but a
clever one—a fascinating one, as you call this ‘Evelina,’
should never be allowed to cross the threshold. But, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
your leave, sir, we will talk no more upon a question on
which I know we shall never agree.”</p>

<p>“That is the most satisfactory proposal that could be
made,” said Mr. Crisp, bowing. “I will only add that
since you are so fully sensible of the danger of a delightful
book in your house, you will take prompt measures to
prevent the baleful influence of ‘Evelina’ from pervading
your home, by despatching the third volume to me
without delay. The third volume of such a novel may
in truth be likened to the match in the barrel of gunpowder:
’tis the most dangerous part of the whole. The
first two volumes are like the gunpowder—comparatively
innocent, but the moment the third volume is
attached—phew! So you would do well not to delay in
getting rid of such an inflammatory composition, Mrs.
Burney.”</p>

<p>“I promise you that you shall have it at once, sir,”
said Mrs. Burney. “And I trust that you will not allow
the first and second to return to my house. A barrel of
gunpowder may be as innocent as you say, so long as the
match is withheld, but still I have no intention of turning
our home into a powder magazine.”</p>

<p>That was the last reference made to “Evelina” while
Mrs. Burney and the two girls remained at Chessington.
They went away so as to be back in St. Martin’s Street
in time for dinner; but the moment they were together
in the chaise Mrs. Burney burst out once more in her
denunciation of the vice of novel reading. From her
general treatment of the theme she proceeded—as the
girls feared she would—to the particular instance of its
practice which had just come under her notice. She
administered to poor Susy a sound scolding for having
received the book from her cousin Edward in secret, and
another to poor Lottie for having ventured to read it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
without asking leave. The girls were soon reduced to
tears, but not a word did they say in reply. They were
loyal to their sister and her secret with which they had
been entrusted. Not a word did either of them utter.</p>

<p>The drive home on that lovely afternoon was a dreary
one, especially after Mrs. Burney had said:</p>

<p>“I fear that this duplicity has been going on for a
long time in our house. Yes, I have noticed more than
once an exchange of meaning glances between you and
Fanny, and sometimes, too, when your cousin Edward
was in the room. It seemed to me that you had some
secret in common which you were determined to keep
from me. I said nothing at that time, for though my
suspicions were awakened, yet I thought it best to take
the most favourable view of the matter, and I assumed
that the secret—if there was a secret—was an innocent
one—such as girls in a family may share among themselves
about some trifling thing; but now I have no doubt
that your glances and your winks and your elbowings
had to do with the smuggling of books into the house for
your surreptitious reading. I am ashamed of you. It
hurts me deeply to find that, after all the care I have
taken to preserve you in innocence of the world and its
wickedness, you have been behaving with such duplicity.
I shall, of course, think it my duty to let your father
know what I have found out, and he may be able to
suggest some means of preventing a repetition of such
conduct.”</p>

<p>The poor girls dared not even look at each other for
mutual sympathy, lest such glances should be interpreted
by their mother as a further attempt to pursue the
scheme of duplicity with which she had charged them.
They could only sit tearful and silent until they were
once again in St. Martin’s Street. They longed to rush<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
upstairs together to their room and mingle their tears
in a sisterly embrace before determining how they should
meet their stepmother’s charges in the presence of their
father.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Burney was too astute a strategist to permit
them to consult together.</p>

<p>“Is your master within?” she inquired of William,
the manservant, who opened the door for them.</p>

<p>“He is in the library, madam, with Mrs. Esther,” replied
the man.</p>

<p>“So much the better,” said Mrs. Burney to the girls.
“We shall go directly to him, and your sister Esther
will be present.”</p>

<p>She made them precede her to the room that was called
the library. Dr. Burney and Hetty were laughing together
across the table—the sound of their merriment
had been heard by the girls before the door was opened.
But at the portentous gravity of the entrance of Mrs.
Burney her husband became grave.</p>

<p>“You have returned early,” he said, “and—good
heavens! you have been weeping—you do not bring bad
news—Fanny has not had a relapse?”</p>

<p>“Fanny is quite well; but I bring you bad news,” replied
Mrs. Burney. “You will, I am sure, regard it as
the worst possible news when I tell you that she, as well
as her sisters here, have been guilty of the grossest disobedience—a
conspiracy of disobedience, I may call it.”</p>

<p>“I am amazed—and grieved,” said he. “But I can
scarcely believe that, brought up as they have been—”</p>

<p>“They do not deny it,” said she. “I only discovered
by chance that, in defiance of our rule against novel
reading, they have been trafficking with their cousin
Edward to procure novels for their secret reading, and
the latest they smuggled into the house is that one called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
‘Evelina’—I actually found Fanny reading the book to
Mr. Crisp, and her sisters admitted—”</p>

<p>“But what did Fanny admit?” he cried.</p>

<p>“She admitted that Edward had procured the book
at her request,” replied his wife. “Was not that
enough?”</p>

<p>“Not half enough—not a quarter enough, considering
that it was Fanny who wrote ‘Evelina’ with her own
hand and under our very noses without our suspecting
it,” said Dr. Burney quietly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Burney looked at him dumbly for more than a
whole minute. There was silence in the room.</p>

<p>Then she sat slowly down on the nearest chair, still
keeping her eyes fixed upon him.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXII</h2>

<p>Doctor Burney sat for a long time staring at a
point high above his wife’s head. The eldest
daughter, Hetty, standing at the other side of the writing-table,
was radiant; her eyes were dancing. The two
others were standing together—huddled together, it
might be said, for they suggested a pair of lambs recently
frightened—doubtful of what is going to happen next
and feeling that the closer they are to each other the
safer they will be.</p>

<p>“Did you ever hear of anything so funny?” said
Hetty, glancing around and still radiant.</p>

<p>Her father got upon his feet.</p>

<p>“And she was the only one that never had any attention,”
said he, as if he had not heard Hetty’s remark.
“Fanny was left to make her own way as pleased her
best—no one troubled about her education. She was
left to pick up knowledge as best she could—the crumbs
that fell from the others’ table—that was how she picked
up French when the others came back from school, and
now she speaks it with the best of them.... And so
shy! Tell me, if you can, how she got her knowledge of
things—the things in that book—the pictures red with
life—the real life-blood of men and women—love—emotion—pathos—all
that make up life—and don’t forget
the characterization—that’s what seems to me all but
miraculous. Hogarth—we all know that Hogarth drew
his characters and fitted them into his pictures because
he made it a point to walk among them and look at them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
with observant eyes; but tell me, if you can, what chance
that child had of seeing anything; and yet she has filled
her canvas, and every bit is made up of firm, true drawing.
That is the chief wonder.”</p>

<p>He spoke evidently under the impulse of a great excitement
at first, not looking at anyone in particular—just
skimming them all with his eyes as he paced the
room. But he seemed gradually to recover himself as
he talked, and he appeared to address his last words to
his wife. This assisted her to recover herself also—a
minute or so in advance of him.</p>

<p>“You seem to be sure that Fanny wrote it,” she said,
when he had done. “Is it fair to condemn her before
you make sure?”</p>

<p>Everyone looked at Mrs. Burney; but only her husband
laughed.</p>

<p>“Condemn her—condemn her for having written the
finest novel since Fielding?” he said, with the laugh
still on his face. There was no laugh on hers; on the
contrary, its expression was more serious than ever.</p>

<p>“A novel is a novel,” she said. “I told Mr. Crisp—but
that was only about the reading of novels—the
cleverer they are the more mischievous—dangerous—even
the reading—I never dreamt of her going so far as
to write one, clever or otherwise. But a novel is still a
novel—she must have neglected her duties in the house,
though I failed to observe it ... and sending it to
a bookseller without saying a word to us! Who would
have believed that a young woman with her training—”</p>

<p>“It flashed across me when I read the verses addressed
to myself at the beginning that she had asked my permission
some months ago, and that I had given it—I did
so laughing at the poor child’s credulousness in believing
that any bookseller would print it for her and pay her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
for the privilege—the privilege of making a thousand
pounds out of her book.”</p>

<p>“What! are you serious?—a thousand pounds, did you
say?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Lowndes will make more than a thousand pounds
by the sale of the book—Hetty tells me that he only paid
Fanny twenty for it.”</p>

<p>“What is the world coming to—a fortune in a single
book! And we talked about her being portionless, when
all the time she was more richly endowed than all the
rest of the family; for if she has written one book, she
can certainly write another equally remunerative. Perhaps
she has another ready for the printers.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burney was blessed with the capacity to look at
matters, however artistic they might be, from the standpoint
of the practical housekeeper. The mention of so
sonorous a sum as a thousand pounds caused the scales
of prejudice to fall from the eyes through which she had
regarded the act of authorship, and at that instant she
perceived that it should not be thought of as a delinquency
but as a merit.</p>

<p>And, after all, it appeared that the girl had obtained
the permission of her father to print it—that put quite
a different complexion upon the transaction, did it
not?</p>

<p>And a thousand pounds—that appealed to the good
sense of a practical person and swept away the last cobweb
of prejudice that she had had respecting novels and
their writers.</p>

<p>“Has she another book written, think you?” she inquired
in a tone full of interest. “Of course we shall
see that she gets a better share of Mr. Lowndes’ thousand
pounds than she did for her first.”</p>

<p>“She has not written a line since ‘Evelina,’” said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
Esther. “To be sure, I have not been her <i lang="fr">confidante</i>
since I got married, but I know that she was so frightened
at the thought of what she had done that she would
not write another page.”</p>

<p>“Frightened! What had she to be frightened about?”
cried Mrs. Burney in a tone of actual amazement.</p>

<p>“Goodness knows,” said Esther with a laugh.</p>

<p>The sound of the dinner-bell coming at that moment
had about it also something of the quality of a long,
loud, sonorous outburst of laughter with a cynical tinkle
at the last.</p>

<p>The group in that room dissolved in all directions with
exclamations of dismay at being overtaken by the dinner-hour
so unprepared.</p>

<p>“It is all over now,” said Susy to Lottie, when they
were alone in their room. “I was afraid when she ushered
us so formally into the library that we would be
forced to tell our secret.”</p>

<p>“I made up my mind that no torture of the rack or
wild horses would unseal my lips,” said Susy, earnestly.
“Do you know, Lottie, I feel quite lonely without our
secret.”</p>

<p>“It is just the same with me, dear,” said Lottie. “I
feel as if I were suddenly cut off from some great interest
in life—as if I had gone downstairs one morning and
found that someone had stolen the piano. I wonder if
it was Hetty who told the padre.”</p>

<p>“Make haste and we shall soon learn all,” said Susy.</p>

<p class="tb">Before they had finished dinner they learned from
their father how he had got to the bottom of the secret
that they had so cherished.</p>

<p>He had gone as usual to give a music lesson to
Queenie Thrale, and when partaking of some refreshment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
before setting out for London, Mrs. Thrale had
talked to him in terms of the highest praise of “Evelina.”
She had read the book twice over, she told him,
and had lent it to Dr. Johnson, who could talk of
nothing else. Then Mrs. Cholmondeley had arrived on
a visit to Thrale Hall, and she, too, was full of praise of
the book. She, too, had lent her copy to someone else—to
no less important a person than Mr. Edmund Burke,
and he had declared himself as greatly captivated by it
as his friend Sir Joshua Reynolds had been. Everybody
was talking about it, and the question of the authorship
had been as widely discussed as before; Mrs. Cholmondeley
had declared that she would give twenty
guineas to find out for certain who it was that had
written the book.</p>

<p>Mrs. Thrale had thereupon suggested that Dr. Burney
was in a better position than most people for solving the
mystery, going about as he was from one part of the
town to another and being in close touch with all manner
of people.</p>

<p>“But I had not, as you know, so much as read the
book for myself—I seemed to be the only one in town who
had not done so—and on getting home I sent William
post haste to Mr. Lowndes to purchase a set. This done,
I sat down to peruse the first volume. The page opened
on the Ode; it lay beneath my eyes, and I tell you truly
that I did not seem to read it: I seemed to hear Fanny’s
voice reading the verses in my ear, and the truth came
upon me in a flash—incredible though it appeared, I
knew that it was she who had written the book. Hetty
came in before my eyes were dry—she saw the volume
in my hand, and she understood all. ‘You know,’ was
all that she said. I think that the greatest marvel was
the keeping of the secret of the book! To think of its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
being known to four girls and never becoming too great
for them to bear!”</p>

<p>He was appealing to his wife, but she only nodded a
cold acquiescence in his surprise. She remained silent,
however, and this was something to be grateful for, the
girls thought: they knew just what she was thinking,
and they also knew that if they had some little trouble in
keeping their secret, she had very much more in restraining
herself from uttering some comment upon their reticence—their
culpable reticence, she would think it.
They could see that she was greatly displeased at having
been excluded from their secret, since such an exclusion
had forced her into a false position more than once—notably
in the presence of Mr. Crisp, when she had become
the assailant of novels and novel reading generally,
and also when she had scolded them on their return in
the chaise. But they were good girls, and they were
ready to allow that they were in the wrong, even though
they did not think so; that is what really good girls do
in their desire for peace in their homes. And Lottie and
Susy made up their minds that should their stepmother
tax them with double-dealing and deceit, they would not
try to defend themselves. The reflection that they had
kept their sister’s secret would more than compensate
them for any possible humiliation they might suffer at
Mrs. Burney’s hands.</p>

<p>All that Mrs. Burney said at the conclusion of her
husband’s further rhapsody about the marvel of Fanny’s
achievement, considering how she had been generally
thought the dunce of the family, was comprised in a few
phrases uttered in a hurt tone:</p>

<p>“While no one is more pleased than myself to witness
her success, I cannot but feel that she would have shown
herself possessed of a higher sense of her duty as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
daughter if she had consulted her father or his wife in
the matter,” she said.</p>

<p>“That may be true enough,” said Dr. Burney; “but
if she had done so, would she have achieved her purpose
any more fully than she has, I ask you? No, my dear, I
do not feel, with any measure of certainty, that I would
have gone far in my encouragement of her efforts, nor
do I think that you would have felt it consistent with
your principles to do so.”</p>

<p>“I was only referring to the question of a simple girl’s
duty in regard to her parents,” said Mrs. Burney.</p>

<p>“And your judgment on that point is, I am certain,
unassailable,” said he. “But here we have a girl who
is no simple girl, but a genius; and I think that a good
deal of latitude should be allowed to a genius—a little
departure from the hard and fast line of the duties expected
from a simple girl may be permitted in such a
one as Fanny.”</p>

<p>“Well, she has succeeded in her aims—so much is
plain,” said Mrs. Burney. “But I hope that should
any of her sisters set about a similar enterprise—”</p>

<p>But the ringing laughter that came from the sisters,
their father joining in with great heartiness, saved the
need for her to complete her sentence. At first she felt
hurt, but she quickly yielded to the exuberant spirit
that pervaded the atmosphere of the room, and smiled
indulgently, after the manner of a staid elderly lady
who is compelled to take part in the romp of her girls
and boys at Christmas time.</p>

<p>She continued smiling, and the others continued laughing,
and this spirit of good humour was maintained until
bedtime.</p>

<p>The girls knew that they would not be scolded for
their participation in Fanny’s secret; for Fanny by her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
success had justified any amount of double-dealing. If
Fanny had made a fool of herself they would feel that
they deserved to participate in her scolding; but success
is easily pardoned, and so they rightly counted upon a
general amnesty. What was it that their father had
said about a thousand pounds?</p>

<p>They went to bed quite happy, in spite of being deprived
of the fearful joy of having a secret to keep.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII</h2>

<p>Dr. Burney had given instructions that Fanny was
not to be communicated with at Chessington until
he had seen her; but that the third volume of the book
was to be sent to Mr. Crisp without delay. He was to
go to Streatham again in two days’ time, and thence to
Chessington, where he would make Mr. Crisp aware of
the identity of the writer of “Evelina.”</p>

<p>He anticipated an interesting hour with Mr. Crisp,
but a very much more interesting half-hour with Mrs.
Thrale; for he meant, of course, to lose no time in letting
that lady into the secret: he knew that she would make
the most of the information he could impart to her; to
be the first to learn what all her friends were striving to
learn would at once place her above Mrs. Cholmondeley,
who was willing to pay twenty guineas for the knowledge,
and even Mrs. Montagu, who was inclined to patronize
Mrs. Thrale and a good many other ladies, in spite of the
fact that Dr. Johnson dined usually five days out of
every week with Mrs. Thrale, but had only dined
once with Mrs. Montagu since she had gone to her new
house.</p>

<p>Dr. Burney was well aware how valuable the Thrale
connection was to him; a teacher of music is apt to look
with sparkling eyes at a houseful of girls whose father
possesses the possibilities of such wealth as was defined
by Dr. Johnson in this particular case as beyond the
dreams of avarice. Dr. Burney had a very nice judgment
on the subject of an influential connection, and so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
was delighted to have a chance of doing a signal good
turn to so deserving a patroness as Mrs. Thrale. Yes,
he felt sure that his half-hour at Streatham Hall would
be the most interesting of the many half-hours he had
spent under the same hospitable roof.</p>

<p>And he was not mistaken in his surmise.</p>

<p>Mrs. Thrale had, as usual, several friends coming to
partake of an early repast with her; and Dr. Burney
had pictured to himself the effect of his announcement to
the company that his daughter had written the book upon
which he was pretty sure the conversation would turn—indeed,
he felt that he would be greatly surprised if the
conversation did not immediately rush to the question
of “Evelina” and remain there for the rest of the afternoon;
for the enterprising ladies would doubtless bring
with them some fresh suggestions or new cues to its
authorship. He pictured himself allowing them to go on
for some time until perhaps a statement would be made
which he should have to contradict point-blank. They
would all look at him in surprise. What did he know
about the matter? Was he interested in the question?
Had he found out anything?</p>

<p>How he would smile while saying quietly:</p>

<p>“Well, I am more or less interested in the matter, the
fact being that ‘Evelina’ is the work of my daughter,
Fanny Burney!”</p>

<p>That would be, he thought, a fitting moment in which
to divulge the secret; he saw the whole scene clearly before
him.</p>

<p>But before he had reached his destination that intuition
of what would commend itself to a patron which
had been so important an auxiliary to his ability in
placing him above his rivals in his profession, overcame
his desire to play the most important part in a dramatic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
scene; he perceived that such a rôle should be taken by
an influential patroness, and not by himself. Thus it
was that when Mrs. Thrale was giving him a cup of
chocolate after his journey he smiled, saying:</p>

<p>“I was greatly interested in the conversation between
Mrs. Cholmondeley and the other ladies when I was last
here.”</p>

<p>“About ‘Evelina’?” she inquired. “Ah, I wonder if
Mrs. Cholmondeley has yet paid over her twenty guineas
to the discoverer of the author. It seems that she has as
arduous a task in regard to ‘Evelina’ as Raleigh had in
regard to his El Dorado.”</p>

<p>“So it would appear,” said Dr. Burney. “Let us
hope that his efforts will be more highly valued than
those of poor Sir Walter. Have you yourself no suspicions
on the subject, madam?”</p>

<p>“Oh, suspicions? There have been as many suspicions
set going on this subject within the month as would be
entertained only by the most imaginative Bow Street
runner. For my own part, I maintain that the book
could only have been writ by our friend Horace Walpole.
He found that his ‘Otranto’ excited so much curiosity
when published without a name, he came to the conclusion
that he would produce another novel with the same
amount of mystery attached to it. The only point
against this assumption is that—”</p>

<p>“That the book was assuredly written by another person,”
said Burney, smiling in a way that he designed to
be somewhat enigmatical.</p>

<p>Mrs. Thrale tried to interpret his smile.</p>

<p>“What!” she exclaimed, “you have formed another
theory—you—you have heard something since you were
last here?”</p>

<p>“Not something, madam—not a mere something, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
everything—everything that is to be known regarding
the writer of that book.”</p>

<p>“Is’t possible? Who is your informant?—the value
of all that you have heard is dependent upon the accuracy
of your informant.”</p>

<p>“The book was written by the person whom I fancied
I knew best of all the people in the world, and yet the
last person whom I would believe capable of such a feat.
The author of the book—I am the author of her being—she
is none other than my daughter Fanny.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Thrale sat staring at him, one arm resting upon
the table, her lips parted as if about to utter an exclamation
of surprise, but unable to do so by reason of her
surprise.</p>

<p>More than a minute had passed before she was able to
speak, and then she could do no more than repeat his
words.</p>

<p>“Your daughter Fanny—your daughter—but is not
Fanny the little shy one that goes into a corner when
you have company?” she asked, in a tone that suggested
that she had heard something too ridiculous to be
believed.</p>

<p>“She is that one, madam,” he replied. “It would
seem as if the corner of a room has its advantages in
enabling one to observe life from a true standpoint.
Two eyes looking out from a corner with a brain behind
them—there you have the true writer of a novel of life
and character. Poor Fanny! How often have not I
talked of her as ‘poor Fanny’? She had no education
except what she contrived to pick up haphazard—a sweet
child—a lovable daughter, but the last person in the
world to be suspected of such a book as ‘Evelina.’”</p>

<p>“You are sure, sir—you have seen—heard—you
know?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>“Beyond any doubt. Her sisters were let into the
secret, but neither of her parents. I know now why that
was—no want of duty—no lack of respect—she began
the book for her own amusement, and it grew under her
hand; she sent it to a bookseller, more as a jest than in
the belief that anything would come of it, and up to the
last it was treated by her and her sisters as a schoolroom
mystery—a nursery secret—and Mrs. Burney and I were
kept out of it solely because we were not of the nursery
or the schoolroom. And when it became a serious matter
we were excluded because they were afraid to reveal it to
us—Fanny herself, dear child!—feared that we would
be concerned if it were still born. It was only when it
was at the point of being published by Mr. Lowndes that
she came to me saying that she had been writing something
and wanted my leave to send it forth, promising
that no name would appear upon the title page. I gave
my leave with a smile, and when I had my laugh at the
innocence of the girl in fancying that any bookseller
would pay for the printing of what she might scribble, I
forgot all about the matter. It was only when I sent for
the book and read the Ode addressed to myself that I
seemed to hear Fanny’s voice speaking the words in my
ear—I told the others so when they returned from visiting
her at Chessington. But meantime Esther had come
to me, and she told me all that was known to her about
the book and its secret.”</p>

<p>“The most wonderful story ever known—more wonderful
than the story of Evelina herself!” cried Mrs.
Thrale. “How people—Mrs. Cholmondeley and the rest—will
lift up their hands! Who among them will believe
it all possible? List, my dear doctor, you must bring
her to me in the first instance—all the others will be
clamouring for her to visit them—I know them! You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
must bring her to me without delay—why not to-day?
I can easily send a chaise for her—a coach if necessary.
Well, if not to-day, to-morrow. I must have her here.
We will understand each other—she and I; and Dr.
Johnson will be with us—quite a little company—for
dinner. You will promise me?”</p>

<p>“Be assured, dear madam, that there is no house apart
from her home where I feel she would be happier than
in this,” said Dr. Burney. “She has often expressed
the warmest admiration for you, and I know that her
dearest wish is to be on terms of intimacy with you.”</p>

<p>“The sweet girl! she shall have her dearest wish gratified
to the fullest extent, sir. You will bring her as early
to-morrow as it suits you. Good heavens! to think of
that dear retiring child taking the town by storm! Dr.
Johnson wrote to me no later than last evening, expressing
once more his delight in reading the book, and Mr.
Burke, too—but you heard about Mr. Burke. I will
never forget your courtesy in telling me first of all your
friends that she was the author, dear doctor.”</p>

<p>“If not you, madam, whom would I have told?”</p>

<p>“I shall be ever grateful. You will give me leave to
make the revelation to my friends who will be here to-day?”</p>

<p>“It is open for you to tell them all that I have told
you, my dear madam; and you may truthfully add that
if the writing of the book will bring her into closer intimacy
with Mrs. Thrale, the author will feel that it has
not been written in vain.”</p>

<p>He made his lowest bow on rising from the table to
receive his pupil, who entered the room at that moment.</p>

<p>He had confidence that he was right in his intuition
that his patroness would act with good effect the rôle
which he had relinquished in her favour, when her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
friends would arrive in another hour for their “collation”;
and he was ready to allow that none could have
played the part more neatly than she did when the time
came to prove how much better-informed she was than
the rest of the world. She might have been possessed of
the knowledge that Miss Burney was the writer of “Evelina”
from the first, from the easy and natural way in
which she said:</p>

<p>“Pray do not trouble yourselves telling me what Mrs.
Cholmondeley said to Mr. Lowndes, or what Mr. Lowndes
said to someone else about the writer of the novel; for it
happens that I know, and have known for—for some
time the name of the author.”</p>

<p>There were a few little exclamations of surprise, and
a very pretty uplifting of several pairs of jewelled hands
at this calm announcement.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” she continued, “the writer is a friend of
my own, and the daughter of one of my most valued
friends, and if any people talk to you in future of ‘Evelina’
being the work of Mr. Walpole or Mr. Anstey or
any man of letters, pay no attention to these astute investigators,
but tell them that I said the book is the work
of Miss Fanny Burney, one of the daughters of the celebrated
Dr. Charles Burney, himself the author of a History
of Music’ that will live so long as the English language
has a literature of its own.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Thrale did it all with amazing neatness, Dr. Burney
thought; and the attempt that she made to conceal
the expression of triumph in the glance that she gave to
her guests let him know that his tact had been exercised
in the right direction. Mrs. Thrale was not the woman
to forget that he had given her such a chance of proving
to her friends how intimate was her association with the
literary history of the day. She had been for several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
years the patroness of Dr. Johnson, who had written the
best dictionary, and now she was about to take under
her protection Miss Burney, who had written the best
novel. He knew that Mrs. Thrale was almost as glad to
be able to reveal the secret of “Evelina” as if she had
written the book herself.</p>

<p>And everyone else at the table felt that Mrs. Thrale
was indeed an amazingly clever woman; and wondered
how Mrs. Cholmondeley would feel when she had learned
that she had been forestalled in her quest after the information
on which she had placed a value of twenty
guineas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV</h2>

<p>It had all come to her now. She had had her dreams
from time to time when working at her novel—dreams
of recognition—of being received on terms of
equality by some of the lesser literary people who had
visited the house in St. Martin’s Street, and had gone
away praising the musical talents of her sisters, but
leaving her unnoticed. Her aspirations had been humble,
but it seemed to her so stupid to be stupid in the
midst of a brilliant household, that she longed to be able
to do something that would, at least, cause their visitors
of distinction to glance into her corner and recognize her
name when it was spoken in their hearing. That was all
she longed for at first—to be recognized as “the one who
writes,” as people recognized “the one who plays.”</p>

<p>But since Signor Rauzzini had come upon the scene her
ambitions had widened. She dreamt not merely of
recognition, but of distinction, so that he might be proud
of her, and that she might not merely be spoken of as the
wife of the Roman singer. That dream of hers had invariably
been followed by a feeling of depression as she
reflected upon the improbability of its ever being realized,
and if it should not be realized, all hope of happiness
would pass from her life. Thus it was that for some
months she had lived with the cold finger of despair
constantly pressing upon her heart. She was so practical—so
reasonable—that she could never yield herself
up to the fascination of the Fool’s Paradise of dreams;
she was ready to estimate her chances of literary success,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
and the result of the operation was depressing. How
could any young woman who had seen so little of life,
and who had been so imperfectly educated, have any
hope to be received as a writer of distinction? What
claim to distinction could such a girl as she advance in
the face of the competition that was going on around her
in every branch of distinctive work?</p>

<p>For some months her good sense and her clear head
were her greatest enemies; evermore bringing her back
to the logic of a life in which everything is represented
by figures, from a great artistic success to a butcher’s
bill—a life in which dreams play a part of no greater
significance than the splendid colours clinging about the
West in the unalterable routine of the setting sun.</p>

<p>Many times she had awakened in the night to weep as
she felt the bitterness of defeat; for her book had been
given to the world and the world had received it as the
sea receives a stone that is flung upon its surface. That
simile of the stone and the sea was constantly recurring
to her, and every time she saw that it was weak—that
it fell short of meeting her case, for her book had made
no stir whatsoever in the world, whereas a stone, however
small it might be, could not be given to the sea
without creating some stir on the surface of the waters.</p>

<p>And then, quite unexpectedly, had come a whisper
from the world to tell her that her book had not been
submerged: the whisper had increased in volume until
it had sounded in her ears like a shout of acclamation,
telling her that the reality had far surpassed her most
sanguine dreams, and that common-sense reasoning is
sometimes farther astray in its operation than are the
promptings of the most unreasonable ambition.</p>

<p>These were her rose-tinted reflections while driving
with her father from Chessington to Streatham, a journey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
which represented to her the passing from obscurity
to distinction, the crossing of the Jordan and the entering
into the Land of Promise.</p>

<p>Fanny Burney has herself told the story of her
father’s coming to her at Chessington, and of her dear
old friend’s reception of the marvellous news that Dr.
Burney brought to him—of the phrases which she overheard
while the two men were in a room together—the
incredulous exclamations—“Wonderful—it’s wonderful!”—“Why,
she has had very little education but what
she has given herself—less than any of the others”—“The
variety of characters—the variety of scenes, and
the language”—“Wonderful!” And then Mr. Crisp’s
meeting her, catching her by the hands as she was going
in to supper, and crying, “Why, you little hussy, ain’t
you ashamed to look me in the face you—you ‘Evelina,’
you! Why, what a dance you have led me about it!”
Miss Burney has brought the scene vividly before our
eyes in her Diary.</p>

<p>It was one of the happiest days of her life; she saw
the pride with which her father regarded her, for Dr.
Burney was a practical man who valued achievement as
it deserved, and was, besides, the best of fathers, and
the most anxious to advance the interests of his children.
He looked with pride upon his daughter, and talked of
her having made Mr. Lowndes a wealthy man. His estimate
of her earning powers had increased: he now declared
that even if Lowndes had paid a thousand pounds
for the book, his profits off it would enable him to buy
an estate!</p>

<p>It was the happiest evening of her life; and now she
was in the chaise with her beloved father, driving to
Streatham, where they were to dine, and Dr. Johnson
was to be of the party. This meant more than recognition,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
it meant the Land of Promise of her ambitious
dreams.</p>

<p>She had many matters to reflect upon at this time,
but all her reflections led to the one point—her next
meeting with Rauzzini. The truth that had been revealed
to her among Sir Joshua Reynolds’ superb canvases,
that love was more than all else that the world
could give her, remained before her, as a luminous fixed
star, to be a guide to her life; and the happiness that
she now felt was due to the thought that she could go
to the man whom she loved, without a misgiving, without
fearing that he would hear those dreaded voices of the
world saying that he had been a fool to ally himself with
a nonentity, or that she would hear the whispers of those
who might suggest that she had done very well for herself.
She had long before made her resolution only to
go to him when she could do so on terms of equality.
At that time her resolution seemed to shut her out from
all chances of happiness; she knew this, but at the same
time she believed that it would shut both of them out
from every chance of unhappiness; and so she had
allowed it to dominate her life.</p>

<p>That was where her common-sense and her reasonableness
had their way, prevailing over that blind impulse
which she now and again had, to trust to chance—and
love—to overcome every other consideration, and to give
her lover and herself happiness solely by being together.
It was such impulses as this that caused love to be
referred to as blind. But she was now ready to thank
heaven for having given her strength to overcome it
and so to give the victory to reason and good sense.</p>

<p>She made up her mind to write to him before she slept
that very night, telling him what her resolution had been—he
had called it a mystery, not knowing anything about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
it—and asking him to rejoice with her that she had been
able to maintain it, so that the barrier which she had
seen between them was now swept away.</p>

<p>“Come to me—come to me”—that would be the
burden of her letter to him; she would send it to him
and he would come.</p>

<p>The thought made her lean back among the cushions
of the chaise and shut her eyes, the better to enclose
the vision of happiness that came from her heart. He
would come to her and her happiness would be complete.</p>

<p class="tb">So she arrived with her father at Thrale Hall and was
welcomed by Mrs. Thrale in the porch. When she had
made her toilet for dinner she was shown into the drawing-room.
As she entered, she was conscious of the
presence of several men, and the one nearest to her was,
she saw, Signor Rauzzini.</p>

<p>All the men in the room were looking toward her except
Rauzzini. He was standing by the side of a small
table, presenting his profile to her, and his eyes were
gazing across the room at a picture that hung between
the windows, a frown on his face.</p>

<p>She was startled, and the blood rushed to her cheeks.
It would have done so on her entering the room, even
if she had not been surprised to see her lover there when
she believed him to be still in France.</p>

<p>She had stopped before reaching the middle of the
room, and then she was hidden from the view of everybody
by a huge mass of manhood in the person of Dr.
Johnson. He seemed inclined to embrace her; and as
he swung himself close to her, there was no one in the
room that had not a moment of trepidation lest he should
fall over her and crush her flat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Thrale tripped alongside Fanny, as if ready to
die with her.</p>

<p>“Oh, come, Dr. Johnson,” she cried. “I have no intention
of allowing you to monopolize Miss Burney, for
that I perceive is your desire. The gentlemen must be
presented to her in proper form.”</p>

<p>“Madam,” said he, “I understood clearly that Miss
Burney was coming hither for myself alone, and I have
no mind to share so precious a morsel with others. Miss
Burney and I are old friends, give me leave to say; I
have more than once been interested in a book in the
room where she was sitting in her father’s house. Come
to my arms, Miss Burney, and we shall laugh together
at the jealous glances the others cast at me.”</p>

<p>“Miss Burney will sit beside you at dinner, sir, and
that must suffice you for the present,” said Mrs. Thrale,
taking Fanny by the hand.</p>

<p>But Johnson had succeeded, after more than one ineffectual
attempt, in grasping Miss Burney’s left hand,
and in his ponderous playfulness, he refused to relinquish
it, so that she had to make her curtsies to the
gentlemen with Mrs. Thrale on one side of her and
Johnson on the other. There was Mr. Seward and Sir
Joshua Reynolds, and two others besides Signor Rauzzini.
Each of them had a compliment to offer her, and
did so very pleasantly and with great tact.</p>

<p>“Now that is done, Miss Burney and I can sit together
on the sofa, and she will tell me why she loves
the Scotch and I will scold her for it,” said Johnson
complacently.</p>

<p>“Nay, sir, Miss Burney has not yet greeted Signor
Rauzzini,” said Mrs. Thrale. “You and Miss Burney
are already acquainted, I know, Signor Rauzzini, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
you did fancy that she was one of the musical girls of
St. Martin’s Street.”</p>

<p>Rauzzini took a single step away from the table at
which he had remained immovable, and bowed low, without
speaking a word.</p>

<p>Fanny responded. They were separated by at least
three yards.</p>

<p>“Dinner is on the table, sir,” announced a servant
from the door.</p>

<p>“I am not sorry,” said Johnson. “Mrs. Thrale gave
me a solemn promise that Miss Burney should sit
next to me. That was why I kept my eye on Miss
Burney.”</p>

<p>“And hand too, sir,” remarked Mr. Seward.</p>

<p>“Why, yes, sir, and hand too, if you insist,” said Johnson.
“And let me tell you, sir, that a Lichfield man
will keep his hand on anything he wishes to retain when
another Lichfield man is in the same room.”</p>

<p>His laughter set the ornaments on the mantelpiece
a-jingling.</p>

<p>And they went in to dinner before the echoes had died
away.</p>

<p>Mrs. Thrale kept her promise, and Fanny was placed
next to Johnson. But even then he did not let go her
hand. He held it in one of his own and patted it
gently with the other. Fanny glanced down the table
and saw that the eyes of the young Roman were looking
in her direction, and that they were flaming. What
could he mean, she wondered. She had been at first
amazed at his bearing toward her in the drawing-room;
but after a moment’s thought, she had supposed that he
had assumed that distant manner to prevent anyone from
suspecting the intimacy there was between them. But
what could that angry look in his eyes portend? Was it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
possible that he could be jealous of Dr. Johnson’s awkward
attention to her?</p>

<p>She was greatly troubled.</p>

<p>But if he had, indeed, resented Johnson’s attention to
her, such a plea was no longer valid after the first dish
had been served, for in an instant Johnson’s attention
was transferred, with increased force, to the plate before
him, and during the solid part of the meal, at least, it
was never turned in any other direction. Poor Fanny
had never seen him eat, nor had she the same privilege
in respect of Mr. Thrale. But she needed all the encouragement
that her hostess could afford her to enable
her to make even the most moderate meal while such
distractions were in her immediate neighbourhood; and
she came to the conclusion that she had been ridiculously
fastidious over the prodigious tea and its service at Mr.
Barlowe’s in the Poultry.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Thrale was as tactful and as chatty as ever,
and Mr. Seward made pleasant conversation for her,
sitting, as he did, on the other side from Johnson. When
Johnson was eating, his fellow guests understood that
their chance was come to express their views without a
dread of being contradicted by him.</p>

<p>But from the feebleness of her contribution to the
chat of the table, Mrs. Thrale as well as Mr. Seward
perceived that all they had been told about the timidity
of little Miss Burney was even less than the truth.</p>

<p>But for that matter, Signor Rauzzini, who had been
placed between Mrs. Thrale and Dr. Burney, was found
by both of them to be also singularly averse from joining
in the conversation, whether in reply to Burney, who
addressed him in Italian, or to his hostess, who spoke
French to him.</p>

<p>As Mrs. Thrale talked a good deal herself, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
she rose with an impression that there had been no
especial lack of brilliancy at the table.</p>

<p>She took Fanny away with her, her determination being
that if she should fail to draw this shy young
creature out of her shell, she would at any rate convince
her that her hostess was deserving of the reputation
which she enjoyed for learning, combined with vivacity,
so that their companionship could not be otherwise than
profitable after all.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXV</h2>

<p>It was not yet six o’clock and the sun was not due to
set for more than another hour. The evening was
a lovely one. From the shrubberies around the house
came the liquid notes of countless blackbirds and
thrushes, and above the trees of the park the cawing of
the rooks as they wheeled above their nests and settled
upon the branches.</p>

<p>“We shall sit on the terrace for half an hour, if you
have a mind to,” said Mrs. Thrale, taking Fanny through
the drawing-room into a smaller room that opened upon
a long terrace above the beds of the flower-garden. Here
were several seats and a small table bearing writing
materials.</p>

<p>“Here I do most of my correspondence in the summer,”
said Mrs. Thrale. “Sitting at that table in the
open air, I have few distractions, unless I choose to
accept the birds as such; and here I hope you will begin
a new novel, or better still, a comedy that Mr. Sheridan
will produce, with Mrs. Abington in her most charming
gowns—you must give your namesake a chance of
wearing a whole trunkful of gowns.” They seated
themselves, and Mrs. Thrale continued:</p>

<p>“Now I have confided in you how I do my simple
work, and I wish to hear from you by what means you
found time to write your novel. That is the greatest
secret of all associated with ‘Evelina’—so your father
thinks. Mrs. Burney I always knew as a model housekeeper—a
model manager of a family, and how you could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
contrive to write a single page without her knowledge
is what baffles me as well as your father.”</p>

<p>“To tell you all would, I fear, be to confess to a lifetime
of duplicity,” said Fanny. “I am sometimes
shocked now when I reflect upon my double-dealing.”</p>

<p>“Tell me how you first came to stray from the paths
of virtue—such a story is invariably interesting,” said
Mrs. Thrale.</p>

<p>“My story is like all the others,” replied Fanny. “I
only meant to turn aside a little way, but soon I lost
myself and I knew that there was no retracing my
steps.”</p>

<p>“Alas, alas, the old story!” said Mrs. Thrale, with a
long-drawn sigh. “Well, happily, you were not able to
retrace your steps.”</p>

<p>“I had no idea that the story would grow upon me
as it did,” said Fanny. “I really only meant it to be
a diversion for our dear friend, Mr. Crisp, and an exercise
for myself. I wrote a scrap now and again at odd
moments—when I was supposed to be writing to Mr.
Crisp, or copying out my father’s notes for his History,
at home as well as at Chessington, and when I was staying
at Lynn; and so the thing grew and grew until I
was afraid to look at what I had perpetrated.”</p>

<p>“You are paraphrasing <cite>Macbeth</cite>, my dear: ‘I am
afeared to think what I have done: Look on’t again I
dare not,’” said the elder lady. “But with all you were
able to prepare your father’s great work for the press—he
told me as much; so that what your double-dealing
comes to is that you did his writing as well as your
own, and at the same time neglected none of your
ordinary household duties—if you had done so Mrs.
Burney would have informed you of it, I have no doubt.
An excellent housewife, Mrs. Burney! And now you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
shall tell me how you contrived to bring together so
marvellous a group of characters—you who have lived
so short a time in the world, and had so small an amount
of experience.”</p>

<p>“I should like someone to answer that question for
me,” said Fanny. “It was not until I read the book in
print that I began to be surprised at it, and to wonder
how it came to be written and how those characters had
found their way into it.”</p>

<p>But this question was too interesting a one not to be
pursued by Mrs. Thrale; and for half an hour she put
inquiry after inquiry to Fanny respecting the characters,
the incidents and the language of “Evelina.” Mrs.
Thrale was certainly determined to place herself in a
position to prove to her friends that Miss Burney had
made a <i lang="fr">confidante</i> of her in all matters, down to the
smallest detail of the book.</p>

<p>In ordinary circumstances Fanny would have been
delighted to give her her confidence in regard to these
particulars—she had always a childlike pleasure in talking
about her books—but at this time she only did so
with a great effort. For while Mrs. Thrale was plying
her with questions about “Evelina,” there was ever before
Fanny the unanswered question as to what Rauzzini
meant by his coldness and formality both before
dinner and during that meal. What did he mean by
looking at her with that reproachful frown upon his
face? What did he mean by averting his eyes from her
when he had a chance of exchanging confidences with
her, as he had often done before? What did he mean
by sitting at the table without addressing a single word
to her?</p>

<p>These were the questions which she was struggling
in vain to answer to her own satisfaction all the time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
that Mrs. Thrale was putting inquiry after inquiry to
her upon a matter that Fanny now regarded as insignificant
compared with the one that she was trying to
answer for herself.</p>

<p>Mrs. Thrale was just beginning a series of questions
on the subject of the comedy which she meant Miss
Burney to write, when a servant appeared with a
message for the former.</p>

<p>“Tiresome!” exclaimed Fanny’s hostess, rising.
“Here is some insignificant household matter that can
only be dealt with by the mistress—summer frocks for
two girls: the carrier has brought some boxes—the summer
has come upon us before spring has prepared us
for its arrival, and there has been a despairing cry heard
in the nursery. I need not excuse myself to you, Miss
Burney. You will spare me for ten minutes.”</p>

<p>Miss Burney hoped that the feeling of relief of which
she was conscious did not show itself on her face, when
she expressed the hope that Mrs. Thrale would not think
of her; she would be quite happy with the birds.</p>

<p>“And the comedy—do not forget the comedy.”</p>

<p>Miss Burney laughed, but before her hostess had
reached the door leading off the terrace, she was once
more immersed in that question:</p>

<p>“What does he mean by his change of attitude in
regard to me?”</p>

<p>It was serious—so much she knew. He had heard
something that had caused him to change. But what
could he have heard? What manner of man was he
that would allow himself to be so influenced by anything
that he might hear against her, without first coming to
her for an explanation?</p>

<p>Her mind went back to the evening when they had
first met. It was in St. Martin’s Street. He was there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
on the invitation of Dr. Burney: but it seemed that he
had become conscious of a sympathy existing between
her and himself, for he had remained by her side for
a full hour while the others in the room were singing
and playing on the piano, and he had held her hand at
parting, expressing the hope, which his eyes confirmed,
that they would soon meet again.</p>

<p>And they had met again and again until one evening
they found themselves alone in an ante-room to the
apartment where a musical programme was being performed
at a great house. Then he had told her that
his happiness depended on her returning the love which
he bore her; and startled though she had been, yet when
he took her hand all her shyness seemed to vanish and
she confessed....</p>

<p>A sound behind her only served to make her memory
seem more vivid, for it was his voice that reached her
ear and it was singing the same aria that he had come
from singing on that evening—the passionate “<cite>Lascia
ch’io pianga</cite>” of Handel. Once more she was listening
to the strains—they came from one of the rooms that
opened upon the terrace—and now the chords of the
accompaniment were struck with a vehemence that had
been absent from her father’s playing to Rauzzini’s singing
upon that occasion.</p>

<p>She listened as if in a dream while the noble, despairing
strain went on to its close, and the melody sobbed
itself into silence—a silence that the birds among the
roses seemed unwilling to break, for only an occasional
note of a thrush was in the air....</p>

<p>She heard the sound of the door opening a little way
down the terrace—of a foot upon the flagged path. She
did not raise her head, but she knew that he was there—only
a few yards away from her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<p>Through the silence there came the cawing of rooks
far away among the trees of the park.</p>

<p>Then all at once she heard his sudden exclamation of
surprise. He had not seen her at first; he saw her now.</p>

<p>“<i lang="it">Dio mio! ella è qui!</i>”</p>

<p>Still she did not turn her head toward him. More
than a minute had passed before she heard his slow
steps as he approached her. He was beside her for
quite as long before he spoke.</p>

<p>“I did not know that you were here,” he said in a
low voice. “But I am glad. It is but right that I
should say good-bye to you alone.”</p>

<p>Then she looked up.</p>

<p>“Why—why—why?” she cried almost piteously.
“Why should you say good-bye? What has made the
change in you?”</p>

<p>“It is not I who have changed: it is you,” said he.
“I loved the sweet, modest, untarnished jewel of a girl—a
pearl hidden away from the sight of men in dim sea-cave—a
violet—ah, I told you how I loved the violet
that hides itself from every eye—that was what you were
when I loved you, and I hoped to return to your side
and find you the same. Well, I return and—ah, where
is the exquisite shrinking one that I looked for? Gone—gone—gone
for ever, and in her place I find one whose
name is in every mouth—not a soft, gentle girl, but a
woman who has put her heart into a book—<i lang="it">Dio mio!</i>
A woman who puts her heart into a book is like a woman
who disrobes in a public place—worse—worse—she exposes
a heart that should be sacred—feelings that it
would be a gross indelicacy to exhibit to the eyes of
man!”</p>

<p>“And that is how you think of me on account of what
I have done?” said she.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>

<p>“How can I think anything else?” he cried. “I told
you that I loved you because you were so unlike others—because
you were like a child for timidity and innocence
of the world. I told you on that last evening we were
together how greatly I admired the act of Miss Linley in
turning her back upon the platform where she had sung
and vowing never to return to it—that was what I told
you I loved—I who have seen how the nature—the
womanly charm of every woman suffers by reason of her
appealing to the public for money—for applause. That
beautiful creature forsook the platform before it was
too late—before the evil influence could work her ruin.
But you—what do I hear the day I return to England?—you
have put your heart—your soul, into a book that
causes your name to be tossed about from mouth
to mouth—Fanny Burney—Fanny Burney—Fanny
Burney—I hear that name, which I regarded as sacred,
spoken as freely as men speak the name of their Kitty
Fisher—their Polly Kennedy—their Fanny Abington!
These are public characters—so are you—oh, my God!
so are you. You should have heard how you were discussed
in that room behind us before you arrived to-day—that
gross man Johnson—he called you by a dozen
pet names as if he had a right—‘Fan’—‘Fannikin’—I
know not what—‘a shy rogue’—that was another! They
laughed! They did not see the degradation of it. You
were a toy of the public—the vulgar crowd! Ah, you
saw how that gross man, who fed himself as a wolf,
tucked you under his arm and the others only smiled!
Oh, I was shocked—shocked!”</p>

<p>“And I felt proud—prouder than I have felt in my
life,” said she. “But now I see what I have lost—forfeited.
Listen to me and I will tell you what my dream
was. I had written that book, but I had no hope of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
printing it until I met you and heard from your lips—all
that I heard.”</p>

<p>“It was the truth—then: I loved you—then.”</p>

<p>“I knew that it was the truth. But who was I that
I should be beloved by you? I felt that it would be
unendurable to me to hear people refer to us—as I knew
they would—the great singer who had stooped to a
nonentity.”</p>

<p>“Ah! that was the charm!”</p>

<p>“Who except you would have said so? I knew what
they would say, and I made up my mind that I would
not go to you except as an equal. I wanted you to marry
someone of whom you would feel proud, and I thought
that I had a little gift which I would lay at your feet.
I did my best to perfect it for your sake; but even when
the book was printed I would not give you my promise
until I had assured myself that the gift would be
pronounced worthy of your acceptance. That was why
I put you off for so many months.”</p>

<p>“Ah, that was your mystery—you called it a
mystery.”</p>

<p>“That was my secret—my mystery. Never mind; I
thought that my hope was realized when everyone about
me was talking of the book and when people whose
opinion was valuable had said it was good—my one
thought, God knows, was that I could go to you—that
I could make you happy, since I should be thought by
the world to be in some measure at least, worthy of you.”</p>

<p>“My poor child! you have not made me happy, but
miserable. No one can make me happy now. I do not
love you now—you are a different person now, and you
can never return to be what you were. That is the
worst of all: you can never return to your former innocence.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>

<p>“I can bear to hear you say even that; for now I
perceive the mistake I made. I should not have, thought
of the difference between us: I should only have had one
thought—that you had offered me your love and that I
was ready to offer you my love. That should have been
enough for me. You were right, I was wrong. Good-bye.”</p>

<p>He looked at her for a few moments—tears were in
his eyes and on his cheeks—then he turned away with
a passionate gesture, crying in his native tongue:</p>

<p>“Mother—mother in heaven! I loved her because
she was of a nature the same as yours—saint-like as a
lily—shrinking from the world—in the world but having
nothing in common with the world. I loved her because
I thought that she was as you were. I will not be a
traitor to your ideal—to your memory.”</p>

<p>He returned to her.</p>

<p>“I am alone in the world; but I know that the spirit
of that saint, my mother, looks down upon me from
her heaven, and will comfort me. My heart is broken.
<i lang="it">Addio! Addio!</i> I do not mean to be cruel—tell me that
you do not accuse me of being cruel!”</p>

<p>“I do not accuse you. I think I understand you—that
is all.”</p>

<p>“<i lang="it">Addio—addio—addio!</i>”</p>

<p>The sound of his voice grew less with every word.</p>

<p>She was alone in the silence of the twilight.</p>

<p class="tb">Not for long, however. She heard the voice of Mrs.
Thrale in the room behind her, followed by the protests
of Dr. Johnson.</p>

<p>“Miss Burney and I want to have an undisturbed
talk together about writing books,” Mrs. Thrale was saying
as she came out upon the terrace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span></p>

<p>“Books, madam; any fool can talk of books, and a
good many fools avail themselves of the licence,” cried
Johnson. “Miss Burney and I are going to talk about
life. Books are not life, Miss Burney.”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” said Miss Burney slowly; “books are not
life—books are not life.”</p>

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in

  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
